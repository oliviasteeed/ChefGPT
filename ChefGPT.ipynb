Add the final touches by drizzling sriracha across the rice and sprinkling over the sesame seeds. Fold your wrap, beginning with the bottom side and following the order of the fillings. You can optionally cut the wrap in half sideways or enjoy as is!', 'Prepare the roasted veggies: Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Wash the potatoes thoroughly with the skin on (for a more nutrient-dense option!) and chop them into wedges shape. In a large bowl, mix together the diced potatoes, lemon zest, thyme, oregano, onion flakes, a pinch of salt, plus 1½ teaspoons (8 ml) of the olive oil. Ensure the potatoes are well coated. Spread the potatoes on a baking tray and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. In the same large mixing bowl, combine the harissa, maple syrup, cumin, the remaining half of the olive oil, and a pinch of salt. Add the chickpeas and broccoli florets, mixing well to coat them thoroughly. Add the chickpeas and broccoli to the baking tray with the potatoes and continue to bake for an additional 20 minutes. While the vegetables are roasting, place the almonds in an oven-safe dish and bake for 7 minutes. Once done, remove from the oven and chop roughly. Alternatively you can use pre-roasted almonds. Prepare the tzatziki: Grate the cucumber and use a clean cloth to squeeze out any excess water. In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the soy yogurt, grated cucumber, dill, garlic and lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper to taste. To serve, spread the tzatziki in a bowl. Add the roasted vegetables on top, followed by the tomatoes and almonds. Enjoy!', 'Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, whisk together the coconut sugar and egg until combined. Whisk in the banana, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt. Add the peanut butter and continue to whisk until the dough is smoothly and evenly combined. It will be thick, wet, and sticky. If the dough becomes too hard to whisk, switch to a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Stir in the chocolate chips. Place the dough in the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. With a cookie scoop or spoon, scoop the dough into 2 tablespoon-sized mounds and place on the prepared baking sheets, leaving 1 1/2 inches of space between each. Sprinkle each cookie with salt, if using. Return any unscooped dough to the refrigerator to chill while the first batch bakes. Bake for 11 to 12 minutes, until the cookies are turning golden at the edges but still look underdone in the center. Place the baking sheet on a cooling rack and let the cookies cool on the sheet for 2 minutes. Gently transfer the cookies to the rack to cool completely (if the cookies are still too delicate to transfer, simply slide the whole piece of parchment with the cookies directly onto the cooling rack). Repeat with the remaining dough, ensuring that you allow the cookie sheets to cool completely between batches.', \"Rinse the red lentils thoroughly under cold water. Optionally, soak the lentils and cashews in cold water overnight. Once soaked, drain the water and rinse again. Although not necessary, this step will make some nutrients more bioavailable. In a large pot, add the lentils, cashews, garlic, chili, ginger, turmeric, cumin, maple syrup, carrots, butternut squash, and vegetable stock. Bring to a soft boil, then reduce the heat, cover partially, and cook for 30 minutes or until the vegetables have softened. Turn off the heat. Blend the soup until perfectly smooth. If using a stand blender, it's recommended to allow it to cool down before blending. Stir in the lemon juice. Adjust salt and pepper to taste, add your favorite toppings, and enjoy!\", 'In a large mixing bowl, stir together mashed banana, vanilla, and peanut butter. Add dry ingredients (cinnamon, brown sugar, oats, salt, and baking soda) to wet ingredients, then stir until just combined. Avoid overmixing. Fold in chocolate chips until evenly distributed. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper. Remove cookie dough from the freezer. Using a 2.5 tablespoon cookie scoop, scoop cold dough into cookie balls, then place them on the baking sheet spaced 2 inches apart. Using your fingertips, gently flatten the rounded tops of the cookie balls. Bake for 9 - 11 minutes or until cookies set around the edges but are still soft in the center. (Cookies will continue to set as they cool, avoid overbaking or cookies will be dry.) If desired, press additional chocolate chips into the tops of warm cookies. Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature up to 3 days.', 'Cook pasta according to package. Drain and set aside in a large pot. While pasta is cooking, add butter and sage leaves to a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-low heat, stirring often. Once butter starts to bubble, stir constantly for about 8-10 minutes until butter browns and turns a deep amber color. Remove sage leaves from butter and place on a separate plate. Set aside for later. As soon as you remove the sage leaves from the pan, immediately add onion to the saucepan and sauté for 4-5 minutes until onion is fragrant and translucent. Add garlic and sauté for 1-2 more minutes. Be careful not to burn garlic! Slowly add almond milk, veggie broth, pumpkin puree, salt, and pepper and whisk to combine. Bring mixture to a simmer. Once pasta is cooked and drained, add to sauce mixture and stir to combine. Stir in sage leaves, parmesan cheese, and spinach until spinach has wilted. Serve immediately topped with pepitas, shredded parmesan, fresh sage leaves, and cracked black pepper.', \"In a large pot or Dutch oven, add oil over medium heat. Once warm, add onion and garlic, and sauté until onions are translucent and fragrant, about 7 minutes. Mix in carrots and celery, and sauté for 5-7 minutes more. Add in the salt, pepper, and flour, and gently toss until veggies are coated. Add milk, vegetable broth, potatoes, bay leaf, thyme, marjoram, and nutmeg. Stir and bring mixture to a boil. Once boiling, turn temperature down to low, cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Remove the bay leaf. Use an immersion blender to blend the soup until somewhat smooth. If you don't have an immersion blender, you can use a potato masher to mash some of the potatoes. I prefer to leave a bit of chunky potato texture to the soup, but if you want it completely smooth, you can fully blend it in a high-powered blender. If you're using a blender, just blend in batches, making sure not to fill your blender past the maximum fill line and be extra careful because the soup will be hot! Spoon soup into bowls for serving and top with toppings of choice. I love serving it with vegan shredded cheese, sour cream, and green onions. Tempeh or coconut bacon bits are also delicious. Let soup cool completely and store in an airtight container for up to 5 days in the fridge.\", 'Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add chicken chunks into the skillet in a single layer. Season with ¼ tsp salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper, cook 3-4 minutes per side until cooked through, for a total of about 8 minutes, or until chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165°F. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil into the same skillet. Add cherry tomatoes, zucchini, broccoli, bell pepper, and onion. Season with remaining ¼ tsp salt and ¼ tsp pepper. Cook for about 5-6 minutes until veggies start to soften and tomatoes start to blister. Be careful not to overcook, otherwise your veggies will become mushy! Add the chicken back to the skillet and stir to combine everything. Turn heat off, then add ½ cup pesto. Stir to coat everything. Serve the pesto chicken and veggies on their own or with cooked pasta or rice. Top with additional pesto, parmesan cheese, and fresh basil, if desired.', 'Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add diced onion and bell pepper, and sauté for about 4-5 minutes until softened. Add spices (chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt, pepper) and frozen corn, and mix to combine. Sauté for 3-4 more minutes or until corn has thawed and is warm. Add cooked chicken and cilantro to the mixture, and stir to combine. Taste and season with additional salt or pepper, if needed. Remove from heat. To assemble the quesadillas, sprinkle a tortilla with ¼ cup of the shredded cheese, leaving a small border all the way around the edge. Spoon ½ cup of the chicken mixture on top of the cheese, then fold the tortilla in half. Repeat with the remaining five tortillas. To cook immediately: Wipe out the skillet (it will still be hot). Increase the heat to medium and lightly coat the skillet with nonstick cooking spray or a little oil. Cook the assembled quesadillas on both sides until golden and the cheese is melted, about 5 to 6 minutes total. Cut the quesadillas into wedges and serve warm with salsa and guacamole.', 'Combine seasoning ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside. Heat 1 Tablespoon of oil over a cast iron pan on medium heat. Once hot add peppers and onion and saute for about 5-7 minutes, until veggies start to soften. Add garlic and half of the seasoning (about 1 ½ Tablespoons) to the veggies and stir to combine. Let veggies saute for 2-3 more minutes. If the pan becomes too dry or the seasoning starts to burn on the pan add a splash of water to the pan. Once veggies reach your desired texture, transfer to a bowl or plate and set aside. Add remaining oil to the cast iron, followed by the chicken strips, remaining seasoning and lime juice. Cook for about 5-6 minutes, until chicken is cooked through. Again, you can add a splash of water if the pan gets too dry. Return veggies to the skillet and stir to combine. Cook for 1-2 more minutes just to heat everything up. Serve chicken and veggies in warm tortillas with toppings of choice. I recommend sour cream (or Greek yogurt), guacamole, shredded lettuce and pico de gallo.', 'Add oil to a dutch oven or large pot and heat over medium heat. Once hot, add onion and red pepper and sauté for 5-7 minutes until softened and fragrant. Add garlic and sauté for 1-2 additional minutes. Add sausage, Italian seasoning, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using). Cook for 7-10 minutes until browned and cooked throughout. Add tomato paste and stir to combine for 1-2 minutes. Add 2 cups of sauce (16 oz), tomatoes, and broth. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, add noodles, then reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 15-20 minutes until noodles are tender. While the soup is simmering, add the remaining 1 cup of sauce and cottage cheese to a blender and blend until smooth and creamy. Once noodles are tender, add spinach, vinegar, and blended cottage cheese mixture. Let simmer for an additional 5 minutes until the spinach has wilted. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed or add additional broth if desired. Serve hot topped with fresh parmesan, mozzarella, and basil. Enjoy!', 'Preheat the oven to 400°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper, set aside. Add tomatoes and garlic to a large bowl and toss them with 3 Tablespoons of olive oil. Spread tomatoes and garlic onto the prepared baking sheet in a single layer and sprinkle with ½ tsp salt and ½ tsp pepper. Roast for 40 minutes. While tomatoes are roasting, in a Dutch oven or large pot, heat remaining 1 Tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions, ½ tsp of salt and ¼ tsp pepper. Sauté, stirring occasionally until onions are translucent and start to brown and caramelize, about 20 minutes. Once onions are caramelized add Italian seasoning and vegetable broth. Let simmer for 5-10 minutes. At this point your tomatoes should be done roasting. Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly before transferring the tomatoes, along with the garlic and juices into the Dutch oven. Turn down heat and add fresh basil. Use an immersion blender to blend the soup until smooth. If you don’t have an immersion blender you can use a blender. Carefully transfer the soup mixture into your blender and blend until smooth or until you reach your desired consistency. You may need to do this in batches, depending on the size of your blender. Taste and add any additional salt and pepper and more vegetable broth, if desired, to reach your preferred consistency. When ready to serve, divide soup into 4 bowls. Garnish with fresh basil and serve with parmesan cheese, as well as, crusty bread, grilled cheese or crackers.', 'In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery, stirring occasionally until veggies have softened and are fragrant, about 7 minutes. Stir in garlic, thyme, cinnamon (if using), bay leaf, salt, and pepper, and cook for 1-2 additional minutes. Add 1 Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to deglaze the pot. Add vegetable broth, applesauce, canned tomatoes, and cabbage, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until cabbage is thoroughly cooked and tender. Remove from heat, remove bay leaf, and stir in the remaining apple cider vinegar. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper, if needed. Serve warm topped with fresh parsley.', 'Egg noodles Olive oil Carrots, peeled and sliced Celery, chopped Yellow onion, peeled and diced Garlic cloves, minced Low-sodium chicken broth Bay leaves Fresh thyme (or dried thyme) Dried oregano Pepper Sea salt Shredded cooked chicken Fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped Lemon juice (optional)', 'Preheat oven to 400°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk sauce ingredients together in a small bowl. Reserve ¼ cup sauce for later and marinate chicken thighs in remaining sauce. While chicken is marinating, prep veggies. Add brussels and sweet potato to a large bowl with oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika, and toss to combine until veggies are evenly coated. Add veggies to half of the sheet pan, then add chicken thighs to the other half of the pan. Discard the rest of the sauce. Roast for about 25-35 minutes, flipping veggies halfway, until veggies are tender and chicken is cooked through with an internal temp of 165°F. Broil for about 2 minutes to crisp up the chicken, if desired. Remove from oven and portion chicken and veggies onto 4 plates. Drizzle 1 Tablespoon of the reserved sauce over each plate.', 'Place a large dutch oven or pot over medium-high heat and add in oil. Once oil is hot, add in garlic, onion, green pepper, and cilantro; cook for a few minutes until onion becomes translucent. Add in green chiles, butternut squash, cumin, and oregano. Saute for a few more minutes to let the spices cook. Add in chicken broth, chicken thighs, corn, salt, pepper, and lime juice. Bring soup to a boil, then cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20-30 minutes until chicken is fully cooked and no longer pink. Once chicken is cooked, remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a cutting board to shred with two forks. Add shredded chicken back to the pot, taste, and adjust seasonings if necessary. Serve and enjoy!', 'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9 inch springform pan with nonstick cooking spray or melted butter. Place cookies into the bowl of a food processor and pulse for 1-2 minutes or until cookies are finely crushed. Add in melted butter and process again until well combined. Dump the mixture into the prepared pie pan and press into the bottom and side evenly. It should come up at least an inch to an inch and a half on the sides. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool. The crust needs to be somewhat cool before adding the filling. To make the filling: In a large saucepan, mix the yolks, sugar, cornstarch and salt until well combined and thick. In a separate pot, bring milk to a slight simmer (do not boil). Once simmering, remove from heat and whisk in ⅓ cup of the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking quickly to avoid curdling. Slowly whisk in the rest of the hot milk, then place the pan over medium heat. Continue whisking until the mixture thickens to a custard-like consistency. Once the mixture thickens, remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract, bourbon, and butter until well combined. Add banana slices all over the bottom of the pie crust, then pour the filling into the cooled crust and smooth the top. Cover with plastic wrap so it touches the filling and refrigerate for 2-4 hours or until cold. To make the whipped cream topping: Beat heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract on high until stiff peaks form. Spread whipped cream evenly over the pie filling, then garnish with dark chocolate shavings or dust with cocoa powder. Serve 9-12 slices, depending on size. Store the pie in the fridge for a few days if properly covered.', 'Heat olive oil in a large pot and add onion with a pinch of salt. Saute onion until it is translucent and tender (not browned), this takes about 5 minutes. Add in the garlic, asparagus and beans and season with a bit of salt and pepper and give it all a stir. Pour in the veggie broth and crank the heat to high bringing everything to a boil. Reduce down to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes or until the asparagus is fork tender. Shut off the heat and let the soup cool for a few minutes before blending. Working in batches, spoon the soup into your blender, filling the blender no more than 1/4-1/3rd of the way up. Place on the lid, leaving it slightly ajar so steam can escape and blend until the soup is rich and creamy. Repeat until you have finished all the soup. Serve right away! Or, transfer back to the pot to reheat and serve OR store in an airtight container in your fridge for up to 5 days.', 'Heat sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add in the onions, garlic, peppers, and carrots. Stir well and cook for five minutes or until the veggies are tender and onions are translucent. Next, stir in spinach, peas, and scallions. Cook for another three minutes or until the veggies are tender but still vibrant. Add in rice, low sodium soy sauce, and sesame seeds. Stir together and cook for five more minutes or until all the flavors have combined and the rice is heated through. In the meantime, heat a small nonstick pan over low heat, add a little coconut oil to the bottom of the pan (you can also use butter or ghee) and then add one Happy Egg to the pan at a time. Once you see the whites start to set up, add a splash of water to the pan and pop on a lid for about 30 seconds. This allows the whites to cook through but leaves the yolks super vibrant and runny. Slide the finished egg right over your fried rice to finish the dish. Repeat for each serving, serve and enjoy!', 'Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake liners (you can use paper or silicone liners) + 4 cups of a second pan (or work in batches since the recipe makes 16 mini pies in total). In a food processor combine; pecans and coconut and pulse back and forth until they have broken down. You want to have a consistency similar to sand that sticks together when pinched between your fingers. Be careful not to over mix or you will end up with nut butter. Add in the maple syrup, coconut oil and sea salt. Pulse again until everything is well combined. Divide the nut mixture as evenly as possible between all sixteen cups and then use your fingers to pat it down in each cup to form a crust for each mini pie. Set aside. In a large bowl combine pumpkin puree, coconut milk/cream, maple syrup, eggs, egg yolk, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract and sea salt. Use a hand mixer to mix until everything is well combined. Divide the filling as evenly as possible between all 16 muffin cups. Pop into the oven for 30 minutes or until set through. Cool completely and then transfer into an airtight container and refrigerate for a minimum of 6 hours.', 'Place the garlic, anchovy fillets, Greek yogurt, Parmesan cheese, Dijon mustard, and lemon juice into the mini food processor. Process the ingredients until smooth and creamy. If the dressing is too thick, you can add a little water or olive oil to thin it out. Blend again until you reach your desired consistency. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Stir in farfalle and cook until tender. Drain and rinse under cold water to cool. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl add the cooled pasta, chopped chicken, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, and garbanzo beans. Drizzle the dressing over the top and toss until everything is well combined and coated with the dressing. Top with a little extra Parmesan cheese and black pepper before serving. Enjoy!', 'Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Pat the fish fillet dry on both sides with a paper towel. Cut the fish into 1 inch thick sticks/strips. They should be about 3 inches long, but this will vary based on your fish filet. Add panko breadcrumbs to a large baking sheet and spread out in an even layer. Spray breadcrumbs with nonstick olive oil cooking spray. Bake for 2 minutes, then stir breadcrumbs (or just give the pan a shake) and then bake for 2-3 minutes or until breadcrumbs are golden brown. Keep heat in the oven. Transfer breadcrumbs to a medium bowl. Whisk in spices: salt, black pepper, onion powder, paprika, garlic powder and cayenne pepper. Set aside. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and almond milk. Set aside. Line the large baking sheet with an oven safe wire metal rack. Spray with nonstick cooking spray. Dip each fish piece into the egg mixture, then use a tong to grab and toss into the breadcrumb mixture and roll it in completely coat with breadcrumbs. Use tongs to transfer each fish stick to the wire rack, placing about 1 inch apart. Generously spray the tops of the fish sticks with nonstick spray. Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes until cooked through. Serves 4. Serve with tartar sauce, my feta sauce, tahini sauce, tzatziki, ketchup or whatever sauce you’d like! Makes 12-16 fish sticks.', 'First make the dressing: in a medium bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, maple syrup, dijon, garlic, salt and pepper. Set aside. Place a large skillet over medium low heat. Add in hazelnuts and toast for 2-3 minutes until nice and golden and fragrant. Remove from the pan and set aside. Cook the bacon: add bacon to a large skillet or pan and place over medium heat, cook bacon on both sides until crispy and golden brown. If the pan starts to smoke at any point, simply lower the heat. I always cook my bacon on medium low heat. Once bacon is done, blot with a paper towel to absorb excess grease, then chop into bite sized pieces. Add olive oil to the same large skillet and turn up the heat to medium high. Stir in brussels sprouts and saute for a few minutes until they start to become slightly golden brown. Turn heat to low and add in the dressing, parmesan cheese and bacon; saute for a few more minutes so the cheese melts then serve immediately. Serves 4-6. Garnish with extra bacon, hazelnuts and shaved parmesan.', 'Make sure your grilled or cooked chicken is ready. You can use leftover chicken or grill it fresh. Dice it into ½ inch cubes or shred it, based on preference. Cook the bacon: Add bacon to a large skillet or pan and cook over medium heat until crispy and golden brown. Once done, blot with a paper towel and chop into bite-sized pieces. Cook the pasta: Boil the pasta until al dente, drain, and place in a large bowl. Make the Greek yogurt ranch: In a small bowl, combine Greek yogurt and ranch dressing until smooth and creamy. Pour the Greek yogurt ranch over the pasta and mix until well combined. Add the chicken, chopped bacon, corn, halved cherry tomatoes, sliced red onion, and diced avocado to the pasta. Gently toss to combine. Taste and adjust seasonings as necessary, adding more salt, pepper, or extra ranch dressing if desired. Serve the pasta salad and garnish with additional corn, tomatoes, red onion, avocado, and bacon, if desired.', 'Place chicken in a large ziplock bag or bowl. To make the marinade, whisk together lime juice, zest, olive oil, garlic, honey, and cilantro until combined and pour over top of chicken until completely coated. Cover and marinate chicken for about 4 hours to overnight. To make the coleslaw, combine cabbage, carrots, green onions and cilantro in a large bowl. In a smaller bowl, whisk together lime juice, olive oil, honey and salt and toss together with slaw mixture. To make the avocado crema, combine the avocado, garlic, cilantro, yogurt, lime juice, sriracha and salt/pepper in a food processor and pulse until combined. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil and water until smooth until you have your desired consistency. To cook the chicken, pre-heat outdoor grill or grill pan on medium-high heat and add marinated chicken breasts. Sprinkle with a little salt and cook chicken about 4 to 5 minutes on each side until juices run clear. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes before cutting. This keeps them juicy! To assemble the tacos, place chicken in a tortilla and top with slaw and a drizzle of the avocado crema. Serve with a fresh squeeze of lime and enjoy!', 'Add coconut oil to a large pot and place over medium heat. Once oil is hot, add in onion and sauté until onion is translucent, about 3-5 minutes. Stir in the following spices: turmeric, cumin, cinnamon, and salt and pepper; cook for 30 seconds more. Next add in broth (or water) and quinoa; bring mixture to a boil, then cover, reduce heat to low and cook for exactly 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, remove from heat and fluff quinoa with a fork.

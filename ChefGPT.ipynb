In a large bowl, mix together the diced potatoes, lemon zest, thyme, oregano, onion flakes, a pinch of salt, plus 1½ teaspoons (8 ml) of the olive oil. Ensure the potatoes are well coated. Spread the potatoes on a baking tray and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. In the same large mixing bowl, combine the harissa, maple syrup, cumin, the remaining half of the olive oil, and a pinch of salt. Add the chickpeas and broccoli florets, mixing well to coat them thoroughly. Add the chickpeas and broccoli to the baking tray with the potatoes and continue to bake for an additional 20 minutes. While the vegetables are roasting, place the almonds in an oven-safe dish and bake for 7 minutes. Once done, remove from the oven and chop roughly. Alternatively you can use pre-roasted almonds. Prepare the tzatziki: Grate the cucumber and use a clean cloth to squeeze out any excess water.

If the dough becomes too hard to whisk, switch to a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Stir in the chocolate chips. Place the dough in the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. With a cookie scoop or spoon, scoop the dough into 2 tablespoon-sized mounds and place on the prepared baking sheets, leaving 1 1/2 inches of space between each. Sprinkle each cookie with salt, if using. Return any unscooped dough to the refrigerator to chill while the first batch bakes. Bake for 11 to 12 minutes, until the cookies are turning golden at the edges but still look underdone in the center. Place the baking sheet on a cooling rack and let the cookies cool on the sheet for 2 minutes. Gently transfer the cookies to the rack to cool completely (if the cookies are still too delicate to transfer, simply slide the whole piece of parchment with the cookies directly onto the cooling rack). Repeat with the remaining dough, ensuring that you allow the cookie sheets to cool completely between batches.', \"Rinse the red lentils thoroughly under cold water. Optionally, soak the lentils and cashews in cold water overnight. Once soaked, drain the water and rinse again. Although not necessary, this step will make some nutrients more bioavailable.

Using your fingertips, gently flatten the rounded tops of the cookie balls. Bake for 9 - 11 minutes or until cookies set around the edges but are still soft in the center. (Cookies will continue to set as they cool, avoid overbaking or cookies will be dry.) If desired, press additional chocolate chips into the tops of warm cookies. Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature up to 3 days.', 'Cook pasta according to package. Drain and set aside in a large pot. While pasta is cooking, add butter and sage leaves to a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-low heat, stirring often. Once butter starts to bubble, stir constantly for about 8-10 minutes until butter browns and turns a deep amber color. Remove sage leaves from butter and place on a separate plate. Set aside for later. As soon as you remove the sage leaves from the pan, immediately add onion to the saucepan and sauté for 4-5 minutes until onion is fragrant and translucent. Add garlic and sauté for 1-2 more minutes. Be careful not to burn garlic! Slowly add almond milk, veggie broth, pumpkin puree, salt, and pepper and whisk to combine. Bring mixture to a simmer.

Serve immediately topped with pepitas, shredded parmesan, fresh sage leaves, and cracked black pepper.', \"In a large pot or Dutch oven, add oil over medium heat. Once warm, add onion and garlic, and sauté until onions are translucent and fragrant, about 7 minutes. Mix in carrots and celery, and sauté for 5-7 minutes more. Add in the salt, pepper, and flour, and gently toss until veggies are coated. Add milk, vegetable broth, potatoes, bay leaf, thyme, marjoram, and nutmeg. Stir and bring mixture to a boil. Once boiling, turn temperature down to low, cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Remove the bay leaf. Use an immersion blender to blend the soup until somewhat smooth. If you don't have an immersion blender, you can use a potato masher to mash some of the potatoes. I prefer to leave a bit of chunky potato texture to the soup, but if you want it completely smooth, you can fully blend it in a high-powered blender. If you're using a blender, just blend in batches, making sure not to fill your blender past the maximum fill line and be extra careful because the soup will be hot! Spoon soup into bowls for serving and top with toppings of choice. I love serving it with vegan shredded cheese, sour cream, and green onions. Tempeh or coconut bacon bits are also delicious. Let soup cool completely and store in an airtight container for up to 5 days in the fridge.\", 'Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add chicken chunks into the skillet in a single layer. Season with ¼ tsp salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper, cook 3-4 minutes per side until cooked through, for a total of about 8 minutes, or until chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165°F. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil into the same skillet. Add cherry tomatoes, zucchini, broccoli, bell pepper, and onion. Season with remaining ¼ tsp salt and ¼ tsp pepper. Cook for about 5-6 minutes until veggies start to soften and tomatoes start to blister. Be careful not to overcook, otherwise your veggies will become mushy! Add the chicken back to the skillet and stir to combine everything. Turn heat off, then add ½ cup pesto. Stir to coat everything. Serve the pesto chicken and veggies on their own or with cooked pasta or rice. Top with additional pesto, parmesan cheese, and fresh basil, if desired.', 'Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add diced onion and bell pepper, and sauté for about 4-5 minutes until softened. Add spices (chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt, pepper) and frozen corn, and mix to combine. Sauté for 3-4 more minutes or until corn has thawed and is warm. Add cooked chicken and cilantro to the mixture, and stir to combine. Taste and season with additional salt or pepper, if needed. Remove from heat. To assemble the quesadillas, sprinkle a tortilla with ¼ cup of the shredded cheese, leaving a small border all the way around the edge. Spoon ½ cup of the chicken mixture on top of the cheese, then fold the tortilla in half. Repeat with the remaining five tortillas. To cook immediately: Wipe out the skillet (it will still be hot). Increase the heat to medium and lightly coat the skillet with nonstick cooking spray or a little oil. Cook the assembled quesadillas on both sides until golden and the cheese is melted, about 5 to 6 minutes total. Cut the quesadillas into wedges and serve warm with salsa and guacamole.', 'Combine seasoning ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside. Heat 1 Tablespoon of oil over a cast iron pan on medium heat. Once hot add peppers and onion and saute for about 5-7 minutes, until veggies start to soften. Add garlic and half of the seasoning (about 1 ½ Tablespoons) to the veggies and stir to combine. Let veggies saute for 2-3 more minutes. If the pan becomes too dry or the seasoning starts to burn on the pan add a splash of water to the pan. Once veggies reach your desired texture, transfer to a bowl or plate and set aside. Add remaining oil to the cast iron, followed by the chicken strips, remaining seasoning and lime juice. Cook for about 5-6 minutes, until chicken is cooked through. Again, you can add a splash of water if the pan gets too dry. Return veggies to the skillet and stir to combine. Cook for 1-2 more minutes just to heat everything up. Serve chicken and veggies in warm tortillas with toppings of choice. I recommend sour cream (or Greek yogurt), guacamole, shredded lettuce and pico de gallo.', 'Add oil to a dutch oven or large pot and heat over medium heat. Once hot, add onion and red pepper and sauté for 5-7 minutes until softened and fragrant. Add garlic and sauté for 1-2 additional minutes. Add sausage, Italian seasoning, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using). Cook for 7-10 minutes until browned and cooked throughout. Add tomato paste and stir to combine for 1-2 minutes. Add 2 cups of sauce (16 oz), tomatoes, and broth. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, add noodles, then reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 15-20 minutes until noodles are tender. While the soup is simmering, add the remaining 1 cup of sauce and cottage cheese to a blender and blend until smooth and creamy. Once noodles are tender, add spinach, vinegar, and blended cottage cheese mixture. Let simmer for an additional 5 minutes until the spinach has wilted. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed or add additional broth if desired. Serve hot topped with fresh parmesan, mozzarella, and basil. Enjoy!', 'Preheat the oven to 400°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper, set aside. Add tomatoes and garlic to a large bowl and toss them with 3 Tablespoons of olive oil.

While tomatoes are roasting, in a Dutch oven or large pot, heat remaining 1 Tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions, ½ tsp of salt and ¼ tsp pepper. Sauté, stirring occasionally until onions are translucent and start to brown and caramelize, about 20 minutes. Once onions are caramelized add Italian seasoning and vegetable broth. Let simmer for 5-10 minutes. At this point your tomatoes should be done roasting. Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly before transferring the tomatoes, along with the garlic and juices into the Dutch oven. Turn down heat and add fresh basil. Use an immersion blender to blend the soup until smooth. If you don’t have an immersion blender you can use a blender. Carefully transfer the soup mixture into your blender and blend until smooth or until you reach your desired consistency. You may need to do this in batches, depending on the size of your blender. Taste and add any additional salt and pepper and more vegetable broth, if desired, to reach your preferred consistency. When ready to serve, divide soup into 4 bowls. Garnish with fresh basil and serve with parmesan cheese, as well as, crusty bread, grilled cheese or crackers.', 'In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat.

Serve and enjoy!', 'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9 inch springform pan with nonstick cooking spray or melted butter. Place cookies into the bowl of a food processor and pulse for 1-2 minutes or until cookies are finely crushed. Add in melted butter and process again until well combined. Dump the mixture into the prepared pie pan and press into the bottom and side evenly. It should come up at least an inch to an inch and a half on the sides. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool. The crust needs to be somewhat cool before adding the filling. To make the filling: In a large saucepan, mix the yolks, sugar, cornstarch and salt until well combined and thick. In a separate pot, bring milk to a slight simmer (do not boil). Once simmering, remove from heat and whisk in ⅓ cup of the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking quickly to avoid curdling. Slowly whisk in the rest of the hot milk, then place the pan over medium heat. Continue whisking until the mixture thickens to a custard-like consistency. Once the mixture thickens, remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract, bourbon, and butter until well combined.

Shut off the heat and let the soup cool for a few minutes before blending. Working in batches, spoon the soup into your blender, filling the blender no more than 1/4-1/3rd of the way up. Place on the lid, leaving it slightly ajar so steam can escape and blend until the soup is rich and creamy. Repeat until you have finished all the soup. Serve right away! Or, transfer back to the pot to reheat and serve OR store in an airtight container in your fridge for up to 5 days.', 'Heat sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add in the onions, garlic, peppers, and carrots. Stir well and cook for five minutes or until the veggies are tender and onions are translucent. Next, stir in spinach, peas, and scallions. Cook for another three minutes or until the veggies are tender but still vibrant. Add in rice, low sodium soy sauce, and sesame seeds. Stir together and cook for five more minutes or until all the flavors have combined and the rice is heated through. In the meantime, heat a small nonstick pan over low heat, add a little coconut oil to the bottom of the pan (you can also use butter or ghee) and then add one Happy Egg to the pan at a time. Once you see the whites start to set up, add a splash of water to the pan and pop on a lid for about 30 seconds. This allows the whites to cook through but leaves the yolks super vibrant and runny. Slide the finished egg right over your fried rice to finish the dish. Repeat for each serving, serve and enjoy!', 'Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake liners (you can use paper or silicone liners) + 4 cups of a second pan (or work in batches since the recipe makes 16 mini pies in total). In a food processor combine; pecans and coconut and pulse back and forth until they have broken down. You want to have a consistency similar to sand that sticks together when pinched between your fingers. Be careful not to over mix or you will end up with nut butter. Add in the maple syrup, coconut oil and sea salt. Pulse again until everything is well combined. Divide the nut mixture as evenly as possible between all sixteen cups and then use your fingers to pat it down in each cup to form a crust for each mini pie. Set aside. In a large bowl combine pumpkin puree, coconut milk/cream, maple syrup, eggs, egg yolk, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract and sea salt. Use a hand mixer to mix until everything is well combined. Divide the filling as evenly as possible between all 16 muffin cups. Pop into the oven for 30 minutes or until set through. Cool completely and then transfer into an airtight container and refrigerate for a minimum of 6 hours.', 'Place the garlic, anchovy fillets, Greek yogurt, Parmesan cheese, Dijon mustard, and lemon juice into the mini food processor. Process the ingredients until smooth and creamy. If the dressing is too thick, you can add a little water or olive oil to thin it out. Blend again until you reach your desired consistency. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Stir in farfalle and cook until tender. Drain and rinse under cold water to cool. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl add the cooled pasta, chopped chicken, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, and garbanzo beans. Drizzle the dressing over the top and toss until everything is well combined and coated with the dressing. Top with a little extra Parmesan cheese and black pepper before serving. Enjoy!', 'Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Pat the fish fillet dry on both sides with a paper towel. Cut the fish into 1 inch thick sticks/strips. They should be about 3 inches long, but this will vary based on your fish filet. Add panko breadcrumbs to a large baking sheet and spread out in an even layer. Spray breadcrumbs with nonstick olive oil cooking spray. Bake for 2 minutes, then stir breadcrumbs (or just give the pan a shake) and then bake for 2-3 minutes or until breadcrumbs are golden brown. Keep heat in the oven. Transfer breadcrumbs to a medium bowl. Whisk in spices: salt, black pepper, onion powder, paprika, garlic powder and cayenne pepper. Set aside. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and almond milk. Set aside. Line the large baking sheet with an oven safe wire metal rack. Spray with nonstick cooking spray. Dip each fish piece into the egg mixture, then use a tong to grab and toss into the breadcrumb mixture and roll it in completely coat with breadcrumbs. Use tongs to transfer each fish stick to the wire rack, placing about 1 inch apart. Generously spray the tops of the fish sticks with nonstick spray. Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes until cooked through. Serves 4. Serve with tartar sauce, my feta sauce, tahini sauce, tzatziki, ketchup or whatever sauce you’d like! Makes 12-16 fish sticks.', 'First make the dressing: in a medium bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, maple syrup, dijon, garlic, salt and pepper. Set aside. Place a large skillet over medium low heat. Add in hazelnuts and toast for 2-3 minutes until nice and golden and fragrant. Remove from the pan and set aside. Cook the bacon: add bacon to a large skillet or pan and place over medium heat, cook bacon on both sides until crispy and golden brown. If the pan starts to smoke at any point, simply lower the heat. I always cook my bacon on medium low heat. Once bacon is done, blot with a paper towel to absorb excess grease, then chop into bite sized pieces. Add olive oil to the same large skillet and turn up the heat to medium high. Stir in brussels sprouts and saute for a few minutes until they start to become slightly golden brown. Turn heat to low and add in the dressing, parmesan cheese and bacon; saute for a few more minutes so the cheese melts then serve immediately. Serves 4-6. Garnish with extra bacon, hazelnuts and shaved parmesan.', 'Make sure your grilled or cooked chicken is ready. You can use leftover chicken or grill it fresh. Dice it into ½ inch cubes or shred it, based on preference. Cook the bacon: Add bacon to a large skillet or pan and cook over medium heat until crispy and golden brown. Once done, blot with a paper towel and chop into bite-sized pieces. Cook the pasta: Boil the pasta until al dente, drain, and place in a large bowl. Make the Greek yogurt ranch: In a small bowl, combine Greek yogurt and ranch dressing until smooth and creamy. Pour the Greek yogurt ranch over the pasta and mix until well combined. Add the chicken, chopped bacon, corn, halved cherry tomatoes, sliced red onion, and diced avocado to the pasta. Gently toss to combine. Taste and adjust seasonings as necessary, adding more salt, pepper, or extra ranch dressing if desired. Serve the pasta salad and garnish with additional corn, tomatoes, red onion, avocado, and bacon, if desired.', 'Place chicken in a large ziplock bag or bowl. To make the marinade, whisk together lime juice, zest, olive oil, garlic, honey, and cilantro until combined and pour over top of chicken until completely coated. Cover and marinate chicken for about 4 hours to overnight. To make the coleslaw, combine cabbage, carrots, green onions and cilantro in a large bowl. In a smaller bowl, whisk together lime juice, olive oil, honey and salt and toss together with slaw mixture. To make the avocado crema, combine the avocado, garlic, cilantro, yogurt, lime juice, sriracha and salt/pepper in a food processor and pulse until combined. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil and water until smooth until you have your desired consistency. To cook the chicken, pre-heat outdoor grill or grill pan on medium-high heat and add marinated chicken breasts. Sprinkle with a little salt and cook chicken about 4 to 5 minutes on each side until juices run clear. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes before cutting. This keeps them juicy! To assemble the tacos, place chicken in a tortilla and top with slaw and a drizzle of the avocado crema. Serve with a fresh squeeze of lime and enjoy!', 'Add coconut oil to a large pot and place over medium heat. Once oil is hot, add in onion and sauté until onion is translucent, about 3-5 minutes. Stir in the following spices: turmeric, cumin, cinnamon, and salt and pepper; cook for 30 seconds more. Next add in broth (or water) and quinoa; bring mixture to a boil, then cover, reduce heat to low and cook for exactly 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, remove from heat and fluff quinoa with a fork. Stir in chickpeas, cranberries, and parsley to the quinoa and mix until well-combined. Taste and adjust seasonings. Garnish with toasted almonds and extra parsley. Serves 4. To serve: Place in mason jars or meal prep containers for lunch throughout the week. Garnish with extra toasted almonds.']\n"

If you don't have an immersion blender, you can use a potato masher to mash some of the potatoes. I prefer to leave a bit of chunky potato texture to the soup, but if you want it completely smooth, you can fully blend it in a high-powered blender. If you're using a blender, just blend in batches, making sure not to fill your blender past the maximum fill line and be extra careful because the soup will be hot! Spoon soup into bowls for serving and top with toppings of choice. I love serving it with vegan shredded cheese, sour cream, and green onions. Tempeh or coconut bacon bits are also delicious.

On a cutting board, sprinkle the garlic with a large pinch of salt and gather it into a small mound. Holding the blunt side of the knife with both hands, press and scrape the knife’s sharp end, holding it at a slight angle, across the garlic mound to flatten it. Repeat, dragging it across the garlic, until you have a smooth paste. Set aside. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch and 11/2 tsp. of the evaporated milk into a slurry. Pour the rest of the evaporated milk into a medium saucepan and stir in the slurry. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking constantly. Turn the heat to low and add the Cheddar gradually by the handful, stirring until the Cheddar is melted and the mixture is smooth. Add the cream cheese and whisk until it melts. Stir in the mayonnaise, pimento peppers, 11/2 tsp. of the chipotle purée, and the garlic paste. Season with salt. Transfer to a serving bowl or keep it warm in a slow cooker and serve immediately. To reheat the sauce, microwave it, stirring every 30 seconds, until fully melted.', 'Pour 3 cups of water into a 7-quart slow cooker. Add the ham, cut-side up, as well as the parsnips and carrots. Pour the maple syrup and apple juice over the ham. Sprinkle the brown sugar over the top. Cook on high, uncovered, for 30 to 45 minutes. Then cover the slow cooker and cook on low until the ham is tender, 3 to 4 hours. When it’s tender, the meat should come off the bone with very little resistance. Taste a small piece for tenderness. Transfer the ham and vegetables to a deep serving platter (reserve the liquid in the pot). Use a pair of kitchen shears or scissors to cut the slices of ham off the bone and let them fall onto the platter. Stir both kinds of mustard and the vinegar into the cooking liquid left in the slow cooker. Taste for seasoning—the sauce may or may not need salt. Pour the liquid over the ham and vegetables, and serve.', \"Cook bacon in a 6-quart heavy pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, then transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, reserving 2 tablespoons fat in pot.

Whisk anchovies, garlic, 3 Tbsp. mayonnaise, 1 Tbsp. mustard, 1 Tbsp. oil, and 11/2 tsp. pepper in a small bowl. Set aside 1 Tbsp. anchovy mayo in another small bowl. Pat chicken dry; season outside and inside all over with salt. Arrange breast side up in a cast-iron skillet and tuck wings underneath. Arrange shallots around (if using legs, nestle under and around); season with salt and pepper. Brush remaining anchovy mayo all over chicken, making sure to get it into the nooks and crannies, then brush shallots with any leftover anchovy mayo. Place chicken in oven so legs are facing toward the back (this is the hottest part of the oven and will help the legs cook before the breast dries out) and roast until some anchovy mayo and fat begin to drip onto shallots, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and, using tongs, turn shallots to coat in drippings. Return skillet to oven and continue to roast chicken, stirring shallots once or twice, until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155°F, 45–55 minutes. If skin starts to get too dark on the top before chicken is done, tent area with foil, leaving the rest of the bird exposed. If using chicken legs, start checking at 40 minutes (a thermometer inserted right at the joint should register 160°F). Transfer chicken and shallots to a cutting board, leaving behind any juices and fat in skillet. If shallots need more time to soften and darken, roast a bit longer without chicken before proceeding. Reserve skillet. Reduce oven temperature to 400°F. Finely grate half of zest of 1 lemon into a large bowl; cut lemon in half and squeeze in juice. Add reserved 1 Tbsp. anchovy mayo, remaining 3 Tbsp. mayo, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and whisk to combine, then stir in Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper. Set dressing aside.

Using slotted spoon, transfer garlic mixture to a blender; reserve pan with oil. Add beans and broth to blender and purée until smooth (it should be the consistency of yogurt); season with salt. Set reserved pan over medium-high and heat oil. Transfer bean purée to skillet and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Working one at a time and using tongs, dip tortillas in bean purée, turning to coat and leaving until softened, about 3 seconds per side (they will soften more as they sit). Transfer to a baking sheet as you go. Spoon 1 Tbsp. chorizo and 1 Tbsp. queso fresco across the center of each tortilla; fold over like a taco. Divide among plates and spoon remaining bean purée over. Top with cilantro, avocado, more onion, remaining chorizo, and remaining queso.', 'Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Cook plantains, turning once, until deep golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels to drain; season with salt. Divide yogurt among bowls; top with plantains and mangoes, then nuts, seeds, and/or coconut as desired.', 'Season chicken all over with 4 tsp. salt. Place in an airtight container and cover.

Set saucepan over medium-low heat and cook, stirring, until salt is dissolved and mixture is warm to the touch. Stir in thyme and sage; remove from heat. Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. butter in a large stainless-steel skillet over medium-high until melted and bubbling. Working in 2 batches, cook chicken, skin side down, until golden underneath, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a 13x9 inch or 3-qt. baking dish and arrange skin side up. Set skillet with pan drippings aside. Nestle potatoes and shallots around chicken (don’t place on top). Pour brown butter cream over chicken and vegetables, making sure herbs and spices are evenly dispersed and tucking herbs into vegetables so they don’t get too crispy when they bake. Bake gratin until cream is mostly reduced and chicken and vegetables are dark golden brown, about 40 minutes. Let gratin cool 5–10 minutes. Meanwhile, pulse bread in a food processor until pieces are about oat-size (you should have about 11/4 cups). Toss breadcrumbs in pan drippings in reserved skillet to coat. Cook over medium heat, scraping up browned bits with a spatula, until deep golden brown, 5–7 minutes. Let cool. To serve, top gratin with breadcrumbs. Serve lemon wedges alongside for squeezing over if desired.', 'Place the zest strips in a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring the water to a boil, then drain. Repeat this process two more times (blanching the orange zest removes any bitter flavors). Place the ginger and orange zest in a jar or heatproof container. In a saucepan, bring the lime juice, vinegar, sugar, and 3/4 teaspoon salt to a boil. Pour over the ginger and orange. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate overnight. The pickled ginger can be refrigerated for a couple of months. Drain the pickled ginger and orange and save 3 tablespoons of the pickling liquid. Add both to a blender or mini food processor, along with the olive oil, chile, and remaining 2 tablespoons salt. Blend until very smooth, scraping down the side of the blender as needed. Transfer to a container and refrigerate until ready to use. The puree can be made a couple of days ahead. (Makes about 1 cup.) Preheat the oven to 375°F. Place the beets in a baking dish (if using a mix of red and golden beets, separate them into two smaller dishes and divide the oil, vinegar, and water between the two dishes). Drizzle with the oil and add the water and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the pan with foil and roast until the beets are tender when pierced with a knife; this can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the thickness of the beets. Let the beets cool, then peel and cut into 1-inch wedges. Place each color of beet, along with any accumulated juices, into a small mixing bowl. In a skillet, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the cashews and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown. Transfer to a heat-proof bowl. Pour 1 inch of oil into a small saucepan and add the sunchokes (there should be just enough oil to cover the sunchokes; add more oil if needed). Turn the heat to medium and stir occasionally; when the sunchokes begin to sizzle and foam, increase the temperature to high and continue frying, stirring constantly, until the sunchokes are light golden brown. At this point the sunchokes will rapidly go from golden brown to burnt, so quickly transfer the chips to paper towels to drain. Lightly season with salt. The sunchoke chips can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for a day or two, or until they start to soften. (Makes about 1/2 cup.) Using a sharp knife, cut the peel and pith off the orange. Working over a bowl, cut the orange between the membranes to release the segments. Dice the segments, then return them to the bowl. Drizzle the beet wedges with a little bit of olive oil, season with salt, and toss. Spread the ginger puree on the bottom of a shallow serving bowl or plate. Arrange the beets over the puree. Sprinkle the chopped orange segments over the beets and grind some pepper over the dish. Top with the cashews, herbs, and sunchoke chips. Serve.', 'Preheat oven to 220°C (425°F). Place the pepitas into the bowl of a food processor and process until finely chopped. Add the kale, garlic, chickpeas, turmeric, coriander, salt and pepper and process until well combined. Add the pumpkin and stir through to combine. Shape large tablespoonfuls of pumpkin mixture into balls. Place on a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper and flatten slightly. Brush well with oil, then bake for 25 minutes or until golden and crisp. To make the pickled carrot slaw, place the carrots, vinegar, honey, chile and coriander in a bowl and toss to combine. Set aside for 5 minutes to pickle. To serve, divide the pickled carrot slaw between bowls and top with pumpkin falafels and serve with yoghurt and tahini.', 'Preheat oven to 220°C (425°F). Scoop the seeds from the squash and discard. Place squash, cut side up, onto a baking tray. Using the tip of a sharp knife, make some shallow slashes into the squash flesh. Combine the oil, maple, chile, salt and pepper and brush over the squash. Cover with aluminium foil and roast for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and roast for a further 40 minutes or until the squash is golden and soft. To make the quinoa tabouli, in a large bowl combine the quinoa, mint, and arugula. To make the lemon tahini dressing, in a small bowl, place the tahini, lemon juice, water, garlic and salt. Mix to combine. To serve, place the squash onto a serving platter and top with the tabouli. Drizzle with the lemon tahini dressing and sprinkle over almonds.', 'Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a 9-inch nonstick metal cake pan with some ghee. In a large bowl, stir together the paneer, confectioners’ sugar, and cardamom until incorporated but still slightly chunky. Add the semolina, ghee, and milk and whisk until smooth. Stir in the cashews and raisins and set aside. Sprinkle the granulated sugar over the bottom of the prepared cake pan. Set the pan on the stove over medium heat and once the sugar just begins to bubble and turn pale golden brown, remove the pan from the heat using tongs. Pour the batter into the pan, using a rubber spatula to scrape the bowl clean. Use the spatula to create a smooth surface if the batter doesn’t settle into an even layer on its own. Carefully transfer the pan to the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool in the pan to room temperature. Run a paring knife around the cake’s edges and then place a serving platter over the cake and gently flip the cake over. Slice and serve with freshly whipped cream or sliced almonds, if desired. The cake will keep in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To clean the pan, add some boiling water to the pan and let it sit for at least 30 minutes to loosen up the browned sugar.', 'In a medium saucepan, heat the milk to 195°F over medium heat. Using a wooden spoon, stir frequently during the heating process to prevent the milk from scalding. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pan when you stir because this is where the milk is most prone to sticking. The milk will become foamy and bubbles will form on its surface once it reaches the desired temperature. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice until evenly distributed, which will cause the separation of curds from the whey. The process should begin right away, but don’t fret if it takes a minute or two. Cover the pan and set aside at room temperature for 10 minutes to let the acid work its magic. Check the mixture at this point: It should be slightly yellow and the curds should have completely separated from the whey. Don’t panic if this hasn’t happened completely yet. Simply add another teaspoon of acid and set aside for a few minutes more. Line a fine-mesh sieve with cheesecloth and set the sieve over a bowl. Ladle the curds and whey into the sieve. Reserve the whey for another use. Season the curds (still in the sieve) with salt, stirring it in using a wooden spoon. Gather up the edges of the cheesecloth into a tight bundle and squeeze the excess whey from the curds. Place the cheesecloth and curds on a large plate and shape them into a square. Wrap the cheesecloth edges around the paneer and place a second plate on top of it to compress it. Set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes. At this point the paneer is ready to use or it can be refrigerated in a covered container for up to 3 days.', 'Preheat your oven to 400°F. Combine the carrot, tomatoes plus their juice, and 1 cup water in a blender. Blitz till it’s as smooth as your blender allows. In an ovenproof 12-inch sauté pan or skillet set over medium heat, cook 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the minced garlic. Watch for the garlic to start sizzling, then stir in the spinach and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Continue stirring for a minute, until all the spinach is wilted. Remove it from the pan and set aside. Add the final tablespoon olive oil to the pan, raise the heat to medium, and add the turkey plus 1 teaspoon salt. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, break the turkey up into small morsels as it browns. When you have browned turkey, add the cumin, paprika, and black pepper. Stir to incorporate, toasting the spices for about 30 seconds. Add the carrot-tomato mixture, the R-Rated Onions, vinegar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Let this cook for about 15 minutes, uncovered, stirring occasionally. You may need to lower the heat to prevent Joe from sticking or splattering. When the ragout is done it will be thick and juicy. If it seems too dry, stir in a little water. Taste the ragout for seasoning and adjust as you like. Turn the heat off and make four indentions in the ragout. Divide the spinach and put equal amounts in each indentation. Top each section of spinach with a cracked egg. Sprinkle the eggs with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Slide the skillet onto the middle rack of your preheated oven. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the whites are set and the yolks are slightly runny. To serve, scatter ribbons of Parmigiano Reggiano or another hard cheese over the top. If bread is your thing, this is great with toast.', 'Peel your onions and cut them in half through their stem ends—longways, if you will. Slice them thinly with the grain, following the line from root to stem rather than cutting the onion across its belly. Once your onions are sliced, heat your skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil, then the onions and the salt. Let the onions sizzle for a couple minutes. Stir with a wooden spoon or a heatproof spatula and watch as they wilt for about 3 more minutes. At this point, reduce the heat to medium low. Put a lid on and step away for a few minutes. Give the onions a stir every now and then. You don’t have to stand over it like risotto, but don’t go for a walk around the block either. Caramelized bits will accumulate at the bottom and sides of the pan, and that’s good. Just scrape them up and stir them in. A little color building as you go is okay, but don’t rush to brown them. The point is to cook the onions gently, coaxing them through stages of raw, wilted, sweaty, soft, light brown, and finally deeply caramelized. About 45 minutes in, remove the lid for the last time. They should be a light caramel color. Now, with the lid off, you will need to watch more closely and stir more frequently. At some point you may find that despite your best efforts some of the caramelized bits, verging on burnt, cling to the pan and threaten over all onion ruin. Do not fret! Just add a 1/2 cup or so of water and use its energy to help scrape up the stubborn but tasty film. Let the water cook out of course. When you’re smiling over a soft, creamy, fragrant pile of mahogany onions, you’re done. Note: R-Rated Onions will keep in the fridge for a week and in the freezer for 3 months.', 'Preheat oven to 400°F. Whisk oil, miso, maple syrup, and soy sauce in a small bowl until a thick paste forms. Place squash on a rimmed baking sheet and scrape dressing over; toss to coat. Arrange squash in a single layer and roast until fork-tender (it will be a little caramelized in spots), 25–30 minutes. Heat oil in a medium pot over medium-high. Add ginger and garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add broth and bring to a boil. Remove from heat. Set 8 roasted squash wedges (or about 2 cups if using butternut) aside for serving. Add miso and remaining squash to pot and blend with an immersion blender until mostly smooth; season with salt and pepper. (Alternatively, you can let broth cool slightly, then purée with squash and miso in a regular blender.) Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil and cook broccolini until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Using tongs, transfer to a plate. Add noodles to same pot and cook according to packet directions. Drain and divide noodles among bowls. Ladle broth over noodles and arrange broccolini and reserved squash (cut in half if they are very big) on top. Scatter cilantro over.', 'Heat the coconut oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the pumpkin, stir well, and cook, covered, for 15 minutes. Add the onion, garlic, and ají dulce and stir well. Sauté until the onion becomes translucent, 3 to 5 minutes, then add the brown sugar and cumin. Mix well. Cook until the sugar melts, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the coconut milk and broth. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the pumpkin is very soft, about 15 minutes. Using an immersion blender, blend the soup into a smooth purée. Alternatively, remove the solids with a slotted spoon and place in a blender or food processor. Purée until smooth and return to the pan. Bring back to a simmer and cook gently for 5 minutes so the flavors combine. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Serve hot, garnished with the cilantro.', 'Prepare a hot grill or preheat the broiler. With a fork, pierce the eggplants all over, and place on the grill or under the broiler. Grill or broil until completely charred and soft, about 20 minutes, turning frequently (the eggplants will brown and blister quickly). Remove and allow to cool. Once cool, cut open the eggplants and scrape out the flesh. The flesh should be soft to the touch and pulpy, and should easily come away from the skin. Set aside. Heat the canola oil in a frying pan. Add the onion and sauté until translucent. Add the garlic and fry until the garlic turns a dark golden brown, then add the tomato and fry for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the mashed eggplant and cook for about 2 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Garnish with the cilantro and serve with roti.', 'Place the chicken pieces in a bowl and toss with the lime juice. Drain, rinse the chicken with cold water, and drain again. Remove the chicken from the bowl and pat dry with paper towels. Place the chicken in another bowl with the Green Seasoning, salt, chili pepper, and garlic. Toss well to coat and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes but ideally overnight. Combine the curry powder with just enough water to form a thick paste. Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot. Add the curry paste and onion. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes over medium-low heat—do not allow the curry to scorch. Add the chicken pieces and stir well to coat. Add the stock or water, cover, and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the chicken is tender. Remove the lid and simmer for 5 minutes more over medium-high heat, until the sauce reduces by one-third. Serve with roti or white rice.', 'Break open the cardamom pods, remove the seeds, and discard the pods. Place the cardamom seeds, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, and curry leaves in a heavy frying pan and toast, swirling for about 5 minutes, until the spices begin to release their aromas. Place the toasted spices in a food processor or spice grinder and add the peppercorns and cloves. Grind the mixture to a fine powder. Stir in the turmeric. Store in an airtight container. If stored properly, curry powder will keep for at least two months.', 'In a large heavy kettle, cook garlic, onions, celery, and bell peppers in oil over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until softened. Add all remaining ingredients except shrimp and simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes, or until thickened. Stir in shrimp and cook, covered, over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are cooked through, about 5 minutes. Serve shrimp and sauce over cooked rice.', 'Process all the ingredients in a food processor until the mixture forms a thick paste. Alternatively, process in a blender with 2 Tbsp. vinegar. Use immediately, or store in a tightly sealed glass jar in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.', \"If using dried peas, soak them overnight in 3 cups of water. Drain. Bring 3 fresh cups of water to a boil in a saucepan and add the peas. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until cooked almost completely through. Drain and set aside. If using canned beans, drain, rinse with cold water, drain again, and set aside. Wash the rice by placing it in a colander or fine-mesh sieve and running cold water over it until the water runs clear, about 1 minute. Drain well and set aside. Heat the oil over medium heat in a Dutch oven or other heavy, deep pot. Add the sugar and swirl in the pot, stirring constantly; allow it to caramelize to a dark brown color. Add the chicken and stir well to coat. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in 2 cups of water, the coconut milk, bay leaf, Green Seasoning, parsley, thyme, carrots, and scallions. Season with salt. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir the rice, squash, peas, hot pepper, ketchup, and butter into the chicken. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, or until the peas and vegetables are tender. Remove lid and fluff the rice. The rice should be moist but not sticky. Remove bay leaf, thyme sprig, and hot pepper. Note: Pigeon peas are traditional in this dish, but pinto beans or black-eyed peas also work well because, like pigeon peas, they hold their shape well after cooking. Brown sugar is preferable for deeper flavor and color. Chicken is the most common meat in pelau, but cuts of stew beef or lamb work just as well. If using meat, up the cooking time before adding the rice to 40 minutes to allow the meat to get tender. In Tobago, pelau is often made with crab. West Indian pumpkin (also called calabaza) is ideal for this recipe, although the pie or 'cheese' pumpkin common in the U.S., if in season, makes a very good substitute. Butternut squash will also work, although it will be slightly less sweet.\", 'Cover potatoes, garlic, and 1 Tbsp. salt with cold water in a large pot. Bring to a low boil, then reduce heat and simmer (do not boil) until potatoes are very tender when pierced with the tip of a paring knife but not falling apart, 20–25 minutes. Meanwhile, heat milk, thyme, and 3/4 cup butter in a small pot over medium, stirring, until butter is melted. Remove from heat; set aside. Drain potatoes and garlic; return to pot. Toss over low heat until moisture evaporates, 1–2 minutes. Using potato ricer or food mill, immediately press potatoes and garlic into a large bowl (do not let cool). Discard thyme from milk mixture and gradually stir into potatoes, reserving about 1/2 cup if you plan to make in advance (see Do Ahead). Season with 2 tsp. salt and 3/4 tsp. pepper. Fold in sour cream and stir with a spoon until incorporated and very smooth (do not overmix or potatoes will become gummy). Taste and adjust seasonings. Serve topped with remaining 2 Tbsp. butter and more pepper. Mashed potatoes can be made 2 hours ahead; cover and store at room temperature. Or chill, covered, up to 8 hours; reheat over medium with reserved 1/2 cup milk mixture.', 'Combine all the ingredients in a chilled rocks glass. Add one large ice cube and stir for 10 seconds. Garnish with an orange twist.', 'Make the crust. Preheat the oven to 375°F. In a medium bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and butter to combine. Pat the mixture into a 10-inch springform pan, pressing the crumbs firmly in an even layer on the bottom and making sure they come at least halfway up the side of the pan. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, until the crust is fragrant, dry, and toasty. Let cool, then wrap the entire outside of the pan tightly in two layers of foil, all the way to the top. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl using a handheld mixer, cream the plain cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed for about 4 minutes, until incredibly smooth and light. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the Creole Cream Cheese and vanilla paste and beat on medium-high speed for about 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl once more. Decrease the speed to medium and beat in the eggs, one at a time, incorporating each one before adding the next. Mix just until the batter is smooth and uniform. Decrease the oven temperature to 350°F. Pour the batter into the prepared crust and tap the pan gently on the counter a few times to remove any large air bubbles. Place the springform pan in a large baking or roasting pan (just big enough for the springform pan to fit in) and set the pan on the middle rack in the oven. Fill the pan with enough hot water to reach the rim of the springform pan. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the sides of the custard are set and the middle is still just slightly wobbly. Let the cheesecake cool in the water until it is about room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before slicing. In a large heavy-bottomed sauté pan, heat the butter until melted. Stir in the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and honey and let cook until bubbling. Add the apples and toss to coat. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger; stir to combine. Cook for about 4 minutes, or until the apples just start to soften. Remove from the heat, stir in the vanilla, and transfer to a bowl to cool completely before use. The filling can be made up to 3 days ahead of time and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.', 'In a large heavy-bottomed saucepot over medium heat with a kitchen thermometer attached to the rim, warm the milk and buttermilk to 85°F. Add one-quarter of the rennet tablet and transfer the mixture to a plastic container or bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and then poke a few holes in the plastic to allow the steam to escape. Let stand at room temperature in a cool spot in your house for 48 hours. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the solids to a double layer of cheesecloth set over a bowl and discard the liquid. Wrap the solids in the cheesecloth and hang it over the bowl (to catch the whey) in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Discard the whey. Pack the cheese into an airtight plastic container and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.', 'Whisk milk powder baking powder granulated sugar and 2 cups (240 g) flour in a large shallow bowl. Add about a fourth of 3/4 cup warm water (110°) and mix in a wide circular motion with your fingers to gently combine (do not knead). As mixture becomes dry, add more of the water, little by little, and keep mixing gently until a shaggy dough forms; it should be soft and sticky, without dry spots. (Depending on the humidity, you may not need all of the water.) Drizzle 1 Tbsp. oil over dough and gently press with your knuckles so that the top of dough is covered with oil. Cover bowl with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest in a warm spot 15 minutes. Meanwhile, mix shortening and ghee in a small bowl until smooth. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Flour your hands and gently fold dough over on itself once or twice, then roll into a fat cylinder. Working quickly, without handling the dough too much, divide dough into four equal pieces and gently form each piece into a ball. Cover balls with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest 10 minutes. Roll out a dough ball on a lightly floured surface into a 5-6 inch–diameter round. Brush with a quarter of shortening mixture and sprinkle evenly with flour. Cut a slit halfway across the dough, from the center to the edge. Starting on one side of slit, fold cut edge of dough at about a 3/4 inch interval. Continue folding process until you reach the other side of the slit and have formed a cone. Pinch together edges at wide end of cone to seal, then bring both point ends together at the top and gently push in toward center of cone to create a dimple (you don’t need to push in too far). Push point at narrow end of cone in toward the center. You should now have a ball with a dimple on each end. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and repeat with remaining balls of dough. Cover balls with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest 20 minutes. Heat a tawa or griddle over medium until a drop of water immediately sizzles on surface, about 2 minutes. Meanwhile, place a ball of dough on a dimpled side on a lightly floured surface. Gently flatten into a round with your hands, turning once if desired, then roll, rotating often, to a 1/8 inch-thick round, about 10–12 inch. Brush tawa with a thin layer of oil. Cook roti until it begins to bubble slightly across the surface, about 20 seconds. Brush surface of roti with oil and continue to cook until bubbles across surface increase and roti is stiff enough on bottom side to turn, about 1 minute more. Turn roti over and brush surface with oil (bubbles may deflate; that’s okay). Using a spatula, move roti around to avoid hot spots and ensure even cooking, pressing on edges and uncooked spots to increase contact with pan. Continue to cook, turning every 30 seconds or so, until cooked through and both sides are speckled with golden brown spots, 1–2 minutes more. Using 2 spatulas, push opposite edges of roti toward the center. Smack down on the bunched roti with the ends of the spatulas to break up and flake, then turn roti over. Repeat process, scrunching and smacking roti from different directions, until flaky and lightly shredded. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel set inside a bowl or basket and wrap up to keep warm. Repeat with remaining dough balls and more oil, adding finished roti to bowl and covering tightly with towel as you go.', 'Cover eggs with cold water by 1 1/2 inches in a 3-quart heavy saucepan and bring to a rolling boil, partially covered. Reduce heat to low and cook eggs, covered completely, 30 seconds. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 15 minutes. Transfer eggs with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water to stop cooking and let stand 5 minutes. Peel eggs and halve lengthwise. Carefully remove yolks and mash in a bowl with a fork. Add mayonnaise, mustard, and cayenne and stir with fork until smooth, then season with salt and pepper. Fill pastry bag with yolk mixture and pipe into egg whites.', 'In a bowl, combine mangoes, shallots, green chiles, ginger, garlic, vinegar, and salt and mix well. Set aside for 2 hours. In a large saucepan, combine mango mixture and coconut milk and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes, or until mangoes are softened. Have a splash guard and measured spices nearby. Heat oil in a small frying pan over medium-high heat until nearly smoking. Immediately reduce heat to medium. (You can test the heat of the oil by dropping in a couple of seeds. The oil is at the correct temperature when the seeds crackle, but do not burn.) Add mustard seeds and temper for a few seconds, until they stop popping. (Cover with the splash guard, if needed.) Add red chiles and curry leaves and cook for 15–20 seconds. Add the tempered spice mixture to the saucepan and stir to combine. Garnish with fried onions (if using). Serve with rice. Tempering is a traditional method of extracting optimal flavor from Indian spices, and it is a skill learned with practice! Reducing the heat a little before adding the spices prevents the spices from burning and adding a bitterness to your dish. If they do burn, simply start again with fresh spices.', 'Bring piloncillo, canela, cardamom, allspice, peppercorns, salt, and 1 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 15 minutes. Add orange zest; let cool. Strain spiced syrup through a fine-mesh sieve into a measuring glass; discard spices. (You should have about 1 cup.) To make 1 drink, pour 1 cup cold-brew coffee into an ice-filled glass. Stir in 2–3 Tbsp. spiced syrup; top with 2–3 Tbsp. coconut milk. Do Ahead: Syrup can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill.', 'Place an 8-inch ovenproof skillet or cast-iron pan in the oven and preheat to 425°. Once the oven reaches temperature, blend 3 large eggs in a blender until well combined and frothy, 1 minute. Add 1/4 cup of the pumpkin purée, then 1 cup milk, and then 1 Tbsp. of the butter, blending for 30 seconds after each addition. Add 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1/4 tsp. allspice, 1/4 tsp. ground ginger, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1 tsp. of the cinnamon in one addition. Blend again until combined and frothy, 1 minute (scraping down the sides of the blender if necessary). Pull the hot pan from the oven and add the remaining 2 Tbsp. butter, swirling the pan so it melts evenly across the bottom (it will bubble and brown). Once the butter is melted, immediately pour in the Dutch baby batter and return to the oven. Bake until golden brown and slightly puffed, 20 minutes. While the Dutch baby bakes, combine 1/2 cup apple cider, 3 Tbsp. maple syrup, the remaining 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, a pinch of salt, and the rest of the can of pumpkin purée (about 1 1/4 cups) in a small saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat until the mixture starts to bubble, then reduce to medium and cook, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides of the pot with a spatula, until dark and thickened with no raw pumpkin flavor remaining, 20 to 25 minutes. Slice the Dutch baby (it will start to sink as soon as you take it out of the oven) and serve with the pumpkin butter and powdered sugar.', 'Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375°F. Season chicken legs all over with 3 tsp. salt. Swirl 1 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot to coat and heat over medium-high. Place 2 chicken legs, skin side down, in pot, making sure skin is in direct contact with pan. Cook, undisturbed, until dark golden, about 5 minutes. Turn over and cook until golden on other side, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining 2 chicken legs; reserve pot. Meanwhile, working one at a time, stand a bulb, root end down, on a cutting board and slice off a short end to create a flat surface. Turn cut side down and slice 1/2 inch thick, starting from the top end of bulb so the root end can hold the layers in place while you slice. Discard last 1/4 inch (root end) of each bulb and pop out and discard tougher center from slices. Transfer fennel to a large bowl and add half of the grapes, 1/2 tsp. salt, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil; toss to coat. Set aside. Reduce heat to medium and combine broth, honey, chile paste, and remaining 1 tsp. salt in reserved pot. Stir to combine and dissolve salt. Place remaining grapes in pot and arrange chicken legs, skin side up and overlapping if needed, over grapes. Top with dressed fennel and grapes. (Don’t worry if it looks crowded: Fennel will soften as it cooks.) Transfer pot, uncovered, to oven and roast until fennel is slightly softened, with some crispy, caramelized edges, grapes on top are swollen and browned in spots, and chicken is cooked through, 30–40 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer grapes and fennel to a bowl and chicken to a platter. Place pot over medium-high heat and bring braising liquid to a simmer. Cook until reduced by half (you should have about 1 cup liquid), 8–10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vinegar and fennel fronds. Spoon sauce over chicken and serve with fennel and grapes alongside.', 'Preheat oven to 400°. In a skillet, cook the onion and 2 tablespoons of the butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until it is very soft. In a heavy saucepan, melt 6 tablespoons of the remaining butter over moderately low heat, whisk in the flour, and cook the roux, whisking, for 3 minutes. Add the milk, scalded, in a stream, whisking, and bring the sauce to a boil. Simmer the sauce, whisking, for 1 minute and add salt and pepper to taste. Peel the potatoes and slice them 1/8-inch thick. Spread about one third of the sauce in the bottom of a well-buttered 3-quart gratin dish at least 2 1/2-inches deep, cover it with a layer of potato slices, overlapping the slices slightly, and cover the potatoes with one third of the onions. Sprinkle the onions with one third of the Cheddar and continue to layer the remaining sauce, potatoes, onions, and Cheddar in the same manner. Sprinkle the top with bread crumbs, and dot it with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, cut into bits. Bake the mixture, covered with foil, in the middle of preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake the potato mixture for 35 minutes more, or until the top is golden and the potatoes are tender.', 'Preheat your oven to its highest setting (with fan if it has one). Line a baking tray with baking paper. Mix all the marinade ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Add the salmon and turn until well coated in the marinade. Spread the salmon out on the prepared baking tray and roast for 10 minutes until cooked through. Remove from the oven and serve immediately with tortilla wraps, tomatoes, finely sliced onion, coriander leaves and Greek yogurt.', \"Combine the water and yeast in a large mixing bowl (if you have a stand mixer, use that bowl) and let sit for 5 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup (60 grams) bread flour and add the remaining 4 cups to the mixing bowl along with the canola oil. If you have a stand mixer, fit it with the dough hook and knead the mixture on low speed for about 3 minutes, until a sticky but cohesive dough starts to form. Pause occasionally to scrape down the bowl if the flour is clinging to the sides and bottom or climbing up the hook. If you’re making the dough without a stand mixer, mix it with a wooden spoon. In either case, loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let rest for 30 minutes. With your stand mixer on low or while stirring by hand in the mixing bowl, add the salt and, over the course of 2 or 3 minutes, add the remaining 1/2 cup flour, 2 tablespoons at a time. The dough should be more tense; it will feel soft but tacky, although it will pull from the sides of the bowl. Flour your hands generously and use them to pull the dough onto a clean, unfloured work surface. Cup your hands around the dough, rolling it in short, circular strokes and using the sides of your hands to nudge it into a relatively smooth ball. Lightly wipe the inside of a large bowl with canola oil and place the dough inside, flipping it once or twice to coat. Loosely cover the bowl and let the dough rise at a warm room temperature for 1 hour. After 1 hour, the dough will be stretchy but very soft. Leaving it inside the bowl, stretch opposite sides of the dough over the center. Rotate the bowl a quarter-turn and stretch the dough in the same way, then flip the whole mound of dough upside down and cover again. Let rise for 1 hour. Repeat this series of folds one more time, allow it to rise at room temperature for 1 hour, then tightly cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days. The longer the dough is refrigerated, the more flavor it will have. After this rise, it’s ready to be shaped; bear in mind that, once it’s shaped, it will need more time for a final rise, so plan ahead. Wipe a bit of canola oil on a large baking sheet. Dump the dough onto a clean, dry counter, and use a bench scraper or sharp knife to cut it into eight equal pieces; make clean, decisive cuts rather than use a sawing motion, so you don’t deflate all the air inside. Lightly flour your hands and place one palm directly over the dough ball, with all your fingertips touching the counter to make a sort of 'cage' around the dough. Roll it in brisk, small circles on the countertop so it tightens itself into a smoother, more taut ball. Space the rounds of dough a few inches apart, seam side down, on the sheet, and roll to coat them lightly in oil. Tightly cover the sheet with plastic wrap so the dough doesn’t dry out, and let them rise at room temperature for 2 to 4 more hours, until they’re pillowy. Meanwhile, set a baking stone on the center rack of your oven and turn on the broiler. You’re emulating a 700°F wood-burning oven, so you need to give the stone a good long while to preheat before you bake. When the dough is ready, lightly flour a work surface, and use a bench scraper or thin metal spatula to coax one piece into your palm; be sure you don’t manhandle it or you’ll force out the pockets of air that formed while it rose. Dust a little more flour on the top of the dough and onto your rolling pin. With firm, even pressure, briskly roll the dough a few times along its length. Flip it upside down, rotate it a quarter-turn, and roll it the same way, keeping it as round as possible. Repeat, dusting a little extra flour as needed, until it’s about 6 inches across. This next part happens fast and furiously, so make sure you have no distractions—screaming children and natural disasters will have to wait. Use tongs or a good oven mitt to pull the oven rack with the baking stone partially out. Carefully pick up the pita, drape it over your palm, and slap it down onto the stone as if you’re giving it a high-five (just be careful not to touch the hot stone!). Set a timer for 1 minute, and close the oven. Broilers vary in strength but all are quite hot, so don’t turn your back on the oven or the pita may burn. Check on it—it should puff up and build in color, with some beautiful blistered spots. If it’s still pale, close the oven and let it keep baking for 30-second intervals. Use tongs to flip the pita, and let it finish baking with the oven door cracked so you can watch it finish. Pull it out when the second side is as pretty as the first; this can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on your broiler. Bake off the rest of the dough this way; as you get the hang of it, feel free to bake two pitas at a time. Serve these hot or at room temperature.\", 'Using a sharp chef’s knife, score skin of each fish fillet in a crosshatch pattern, making cuts about 1/2 inch apart. Season fillets on both sides with salt and alligator pepper. Toast cubeb peppers in a dry small skillet over medium-low heat, shaking occasionally, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a spice mill or mortar and pestle. Let cool and coarsely grind; set aside. Coarsely chop half of papaya into 1 inch pieces; set remaining half aside. Coarsely chop half of cilantro (leaves and stems); set remaining cilantro aside. Transfer chopped papaya to a blender; add oil and blend, adding 1–2 Tbsp. water to get it going if needed, until smooth. Add chopped cilantro, onion, garlic, ginger, ground chile, 1/4 tsp. salt, and reserved ground cubeb pepper. Blend mixture to a smooth paste. Coat fillets all over with marinade, rubbing into score marks. Place fish, skin side down, in a single layer in a large baking dish. Squeeze juice from half a lemon over. Set remaining lemon half aside for serving. Cover with plastic wrap or a lid and chill at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours. Fill a large bowl with water. Peel yams and slice in half lengthwise, then slice in half crosswise. Cut each quarter into 1/2 inch-thick slabs. (Length of slabs will depend on yam’s size, but you’re going for something that looks like steak fries.) Add yam slices to bowl as you work to prevent oxidation. When all yams are cut, swish in water to remove excess starch, then drain. Refill bowl and repeat process until water is clear, about 2 more times. Add sugar and 1/2 tsp. salt and stir until dissolved; add the drained chips. Let soak 30 minutes. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450°. Drain chips and pat dry with a clean kitchen towel. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with 2 Tbsp. oil. Season with black pepper, then sprinkle with chili powder and remaining 1 tsp. salt. Toss to coat, then spread out into an even layer. Roast chips, turning halfway through, until golden brown and crisp, about 20 minutes. Heat broiler. Scrape off excess marinade from fish and place fillets, skin side up, on another rimmed baking sheet. Broil until browned and crisp on top and cooked through, 5–7 minutes. Using a vegetable peeler, shave reserved papaya into ribbons, pick leaves from reserved cilantro stems, and cut reserved lemon half into wedges. Transfer fish to plates and top with papaya and cilantro. Mound yam chips next to fillets. Serve with shito and lemon wedges alongside.', \"Place apricots in a small bowl and pour in hot water to cover. Let sit 20 minutes, then drain and coarsely chop. Return apricots to same bowl and add rum; stir to coat. Chill at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day. Drain into a mesh sieve set over another small bowl or container. Reserve apricots and rum separately. Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add cinnamon, 3 Tbsp. coconut sugar, and reserved apricots. Cook, stirring occasionally, until apricots are slightly softened and coated in caramel, 6–8 minutes. Add reserved rum and cook, stirring often, until thickened and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Let cool slightly. (Just FYI: You can eat these drunk apricots right away over vanilla ice cream and be very happy.) Toast grains of selim pods and cubeb peppers in a small skillet over medium-low heat, shaking occasionally, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a spice mill or mortar and pestle and let cool. Grind as well as you can. The grains of selim won’t completely break up, so cracked open but mostly whole is okay—you just want to release some of their flavor. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Cook white and red onions, stirring occasionally, until softened and just starting brown, 20–25 minutes. Stir in ground grains of selim and cubeb pepper, garlic, ginger, and remaining 1 tsp. coconut sugar. Cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Add red pepper flakes, rosemary, thyme, prawn powder, and 1 tsp. salt to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Add drunk apricots along with any syrup and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Add tomato purée to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, 4 minutes, then stir in chile powder. Add broth and fresh chile. Cover pot and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until a loose dark brown paste forms, 30–40 minutes. The oil will rise to the surface when the sauce is ready. Remove from heat; taste and season with more salt if needed. If you like texture, leave as is, or blend with an immersion blender (or let it cool slightly and blend it in a blender) to make it smooth. Let cool completely. Spoon shito into jars or an airtight container with at least a 1/4 inch layer of oil on top. Do ahead: Shito can be made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill. Note: The amount of chile described in this recipe is what I would classify as pretty hot—some West Africans might call this medium hot, some very hot. Folks familiar with heat will enjoy this, but if you don’t like super-jacked heat you should probably err on the lower end of the range. West African pantry staples can be found at Zoe's Ghana Kitchen.\", 'Combine the dried beans and kombu in a large container and cover with plenty of water to soak for at least 4 hours or overnight; skip this step if using fresh beans. Drain the beans and kombu and add them to a large pot with enough water to cover by about 1 in. (if using fresh beans, add the kombu now). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; meanwhile, halve the tomatoes and cut the celery, carrot, and leek into about 3 in. pieces. As soon as the water boils, decrease the heat to medium-low and add the vegetables to the pot, along with the whole shallots and minced garlic. Continue to cook at a gentle simmer until the beans are very creamy, 60 to 90 minutes for dried beans and about half that for fresh. Remove the pot from the heat and use a slotted spoon to reserve the tomatoes; remove and discard the other vegetables. Set up a sieve over a heat proof container and strain the beans (there should be about 3 cups or 480 g), reserving all the cooking liquid. In a blender, combine 1 cup (160 g) of the cooked beans with 2 cups (480 ml) of the cooking liquid, plus the tomatoes, anchovies, oil, maple syrup, salt, red pepper flakes, and mustard. Purée until extremely smooth, pour into a large bowl, and fold in the reserved cooked beans by hand. At this point, you can serve it right away or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, gently rewarming over medium-low heat when you’re ready to serve. While the bean soup is cooking, preheat the oven to 325°F. Cut the bacon into 1/4 in. lardons; reserve 3 whole beans for garnish and cut the rest into 2 to 3 in. pieces. In a medium saucepan or Dutch oven, spread the bacon in an even layer and cook over medium-low heat until it starts to turn golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the pieces but leave the fat behind. Increase the heat slightly, and sauté the shallots until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the chopped beans, bacon, and red pepper flakes. Cover with a lid or a tight layer of foil and bake until the beans are very soft, 60 to 90 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest, juice, and garlic as soon as the beans come out of the oven and cover again; the residual steam will cook the garlic. Thinly slice the pickled green beans on the bias. Combine with the cherry tomatoes, oil, and vinegar. To serve, ladle the bean soup into bowls with a big spoonful of the baked beans on top. Garnish with the pickled green bean mix, a swirl of tomato brown butter, crumbled feta, and torn fresh herbs. Leftovers can all be refrigerated in separate airtight containers, though the green bean salad is best on the day it’s made, when the beans are most crisp and the tomatoes are fresh. This works for any amount of dense vegetables or dense, underripe fruit, either whole or cut up, such as carrots, turnips, beets, winter squash, onions, green beans, Brussels sprouts, green tomatoes, small apples, underripe peaches, and whole baby cabbages. Peel off any tough skins, such as on beets, winter squash, and onions, and trim the tops. Leave the vegetables whole or cut them into the desired finished shape. Place the vegetables in a nonreactive container and pour water to completely submerge them; as you do so, keep track of how much water you’re adding since the amount of water will dictate the amount of salt (generally 3.5 percent salt by weight of the water for most vegetables, although cucumbers can handle 4 to 5 percent and the increased salt assists with keeping their texture crispy). With a long wooden spoon, stir kosher salt into the brine (or add the salt, cap the jar, and give it a hearty shake) until the salt is dissolved. Place a weight on top of the vegetables to keep them submerged in the brine. Seal the container, using a lid with an airlock if you have one. If you don’t have an airlock, you’ll just need to open the container every few days or so to release carbon dioxide buildup and check for mold. Place the container in a clean, low-light area with an ambient temperature of 60°F to 68°F until the pickles taste sour, about 3 weeks. Refrigerate indefinitely.', 'Place the tomato in a blender and purée, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve; you should get about 1/2 cup (120 ml). Add the butter to a large skillet and gently cook over medium heat until it starts to brown and smell nutty. Stir in the smooth tomato purée (be careful; it might spatter) and simmer for another minute or so. You’re looking to slightly cook the purée but keep its brightness. The mix won’t emulsify, which is fine. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.', 'Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place the squash, cut sides up, on a sheet pan. Place 1/2 tablespoon butter and 1/2 tablespoon maple syrup in the cavity of each squash. Brush the cut sides with olive oil and sprinkle the squash with 3 teaspoons kosher salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Roast for 40 to 60 minutes, depending on the size of the squash, until tender when pierced with a small knife. Place the squash on a serving platter. If the halves are too large for one serving, cut each piece in half through the stem. Drizzle lightly with extra maple syrup, sprinkle with sea salt, and serve hot. Acorn squash is hard to cut. To halve a whole squash, plunge the blade of a large chef’s knife into the side of the squash as far as it will go. Holding the handle of the knife, bang the squash (with the knife in it) on the board until the blade cuts all the way through.', 'Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium. Cook chile, ginger, garlic, and 2 sliced scallions, tossing, until softened and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add turmeric and cook, stirring frequently, just until darkened and fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add corn and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, tossing occasionally, until corn is beginning to lightly brown, about 5 minutes. Add grains to skillet and cook, tossing often, until heated through and beginning to crisp around the edges, about 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup coconut milk; season with salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, adding 1–2 Tbsp. water if needed to loosen, until flavors have come together, about 3 minutes. Divide corn mixture between plates or shallow bowls and drizzle with more coconut milk. Top with crispy onions and more scallion. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.', 'Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 475°F. Arrange tomatoes on a rimmed baking sheet, covering entire surface (it’s okay if they overlap). Drizzle with oil; season with salt and pepper. Roast until tomatoes begin to look dry on top, 25–30 minutes. Let cool. Meanwhile, cook garlic and butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, swirling often, until butter foams and milk solids turn golden, 5–7 minutes. Strain garlic butter through a fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof measuring cup; transfer garlic and toasty bits to a cutting board. Finely chop and set aside. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F. Pulse crackers and 1/4 tsp. salt in a food processor until fine crumbs form (you should have about 2 cups). Add eggs and 6 Tbsp. garlic butter and pulse until mixture is the consistency of wet sand; set remaining garlic butter aside. Transfer to springform pan. Using a flat-bottomed measuring cup, press crumbs firmly onto bottom and 11/2 inch up sides of pan. Bake crust until edge is just starting to take on color, 8–10 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let crust cool. Mix Taleggio, Parmesan, mayonnaise, chopped thyme, remaining 1/2 tsp. salt, remaining 1/4 tsp. pepper, and reserved chopped garlic in a medium bowl. Gently dollop half of cheese mixture over bottom of crust, then spread into an even layer with an offset spatula (don’t press too hard or you will break the crust). Layer half of tomato slices over and press down to even out layers. Repeat with remaining cheese mixture and tomatoes. Brush remaining garlic butter over tomatoes. Top with shallot and thyme leaves. Set pan on a rimmed baking sheet and bake pie until filling is bubbling vigorously and crust is browned, 60–75 minutes. Transfer to rack and let cool 1 hour before serving. Do Ahead: Pie can be made 1 day ahead. Cover loosely and chill.', 'Toss scallions, ginger, and garlic in a medium bowl to combine. Using a mortar and pestle or the side of a chef’s knife, coarsely crush coriander seeds and add to vegetables along with cumin seeds, black mustard seeds, chile powder and turmeric; set aside. Heat 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Arrange paneer in a single layer in pan and cook until golden brown underneath, about 1 minute. (If paneer is sticking, just give cheese a little more time to brown. It will release from pan once it is sufficiently crisped.) Using a slotted spatula or spoon, transfer paneer to a plate, leaving as much oil behind in pan as possible. Turn browned side up and season generously with salt. Reduce heat to medium and add remaining 1 Tbsp. oil to same skillet. Cook reserved scallion mixture, stirring often, until scallions are wilted and mustard seeds begin to pop, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes, sugar snap peas, and 1 cup water to skillet and season with salt. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Gently smash each tomato open with a spatula (you just want to break them open a little) and simmer until tomato juices thicken slightly, about 3 minutes (it should still be pretty brothy and light). Taste sauce and add more salt if needed. If your tomatoes aren’t super sweet, you may need to add a pinch of sugar at this point to balance their acidity. Add paneer back to pan and simmer until warmed through. Remove pan from heat and toss in mint. Serve with cooked rice.', 'Bring chicken, 3 Tbsp. kosher salt, and 5 cups water to a bare simmer in a medium pot over medium heat (chicken should be submerged). Be patient—this will take a little while. Once liquid begins to simmer, reduce heat to low and cook (water should not be simmering at all now) until juices run clear when thickest part of chicken is pierced, 8–10 minutes. Transfer chicken to a medium bowl; discard poaching liquid. Let chicken sit until cool enough to handle, then shred meat into big pieces; set aside. Meanwhile, place scallions in a small bowl and pour in very cold water to cover; let soak 10 minutes. Drain scallions in a mesh sieve or colander, then rinse under cold running water, swishing vigorously to rinse and to encourage them to curl up. Shake off as much water as possible and place in a large bowl; set aside. Working one at a time, slice cucumbers in half crosswise, then slice each piece in half lengthwise. Place quarters cut side down and slice in half lengthwise again to create 8 pieces total per cucumber. Add to bowl with reserved chicken. Set 1 Tbsp. sesame seeds aside in a small bowl for serving. Crush remaining sesame seeds in a mortar and pestle until some of the seeds have turned to powder, but with plenty of whole seeds left. (Alternatively, you can pulse seeds a few times in a food processor or spice mill, then transfer to a medium bowl before proceeding). Add lime juice, tahini, soy sauce, honey, and red pepper flakes and mash to create a paste. Add 1/4 cup water and whisk to combine (if you don’t have a small enough whisk, work in with the pestle). Taste and season with salt. Add lettuce and cilantro to bowl with reserved scallions. Pour half of dressing over and toss to coat. Arrange on a platter. Pour remaining dressing over chicken and cucumbers, toss to coat, and arrange over greens. Top salad with reserved 1 Tbsp. sesame seeds and squeeze juice from lime half over.', 'Heat olive oil in a small saucepan over medium. Cook garlic, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly and scraping bottom of pan, until slightly darkened, about 3 minutes. Add maple syrup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and Sriracha. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until flavors have come together, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Transfer about half of barbecue sauce to a heatproof bowl and set aside for serving. Prepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off); oil grate. Season chicken generously with salt. Grill chicken over direct heat, turning every minute, until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Move chicken over indirect heat. Cover, positioning vent (if your grill has one) over chicken, and continue to grill, keeping grill covered as much as possible and turning every 5 minutes or so, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 140°F–145°F, 18–25 minutes depending on the size of the pieces. Baste chicken with barbecue sauce and grill, turning and basting occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part registers 160°F for breast and 165°F for dark meat, about 10 minutes longer. Arrange chicken on a platter. Serve with reserved barbecue sauce alongside. Do Ahead: Barbecue sauce can be made 2 weeks ahead. Transfer to an airtight container; cover and chill.', 'Combine egg yolks, kefir, and 11/2 cups dill in a blender Finely grate in 1 garlic clove and blend until smooth Set purée aside Finely chop remaining 11/2 cups dill and set aside separately Melt butter over medium heat in a large skillet Add pine nuts and cook, stirring often, until golden brown, about 2 minutes Add dried currants and cook, stirring often, until plump, about 1 minute Scrape nut mixture into a small bowl; season with salt Wipe out skillet and heat over medium-high Stir together cumin, pepper, and 1 tsp. salt in a small bowl Place lamb in pan and use a sturdy spatula to aggressively flatten (like you’re making smash burgers) Sprinkle spice mixture over Cook, undisturbed, until lamb is well browned and crisp underneath, about 4 minutes Hold back meat and drain off all of the fat Break up meat into small pieces and mix in reserved nut mixture Finely grate in remaining 2 garlic cloves and add reserved chopped dill Cook, stirring, until herbs are wilted, about 1 minute Set aside until pasta is ready Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until 1 minute shy of al dente Drain pasta and return to pot Pour reserved purée over pasta and set over medium heat Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens enough to cling to pasta and just comes to a simmer, about 3 minutes Remove from heat; finely grate zest from lemon half over pasta, then squeeze in juice Season with salt Divide pasta among bowls and top with lamb mixture', 'Rinse rice in several changes of cold water in a medium bowl until water runs clear. Drain well, then transfer to a small saucepan. Pour in 11/4 cups cold water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Give rice a stir so grains don’t stick to the bottom. Cover pot and reduce heat to lowest setting. Cook, undisturbed, until water is evaporated and rice is tender, 18–20 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit, still covered, 10 minutes. Meanwhile, trim dark green tops from scallions and thinly slice; set aside. Thinly slice white and pale green parts of scallions of a deep diagonal. Set aside separately. Mix ginger and 2 Tbsp. oil in a medium bowl. Add cod and season with salt and sprinkle all over with pepper. Toss to coat. Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Cook cod, undisturbed, until golden underneath, about 2 minutes. Turn over and scatter reserved white and pale green scallion parts on top. Cook, shaking the pan a few times, until fish is cooked through and some scallions are caramelized and some are just slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir vinegar and sugar in a small bowl until sugar dissolves. Mix into rice. Add butter and reserved dark green scallion tops and gently stir until butter is melted. Season with salt. Transfer rice to a platter and top with fish; pour any pan juices over.', 'Process one third of salmon (about 8 oz.) in a food processor, scraping down sides as needed, until very smooth and paste-like. Add remaining salmon and pulse until pieces are no bigger than 1/4, inch 4–5 times (be careful not to make it too smooth). Transfer to a large bowl. Remove dark green tops from scallions and finely chop. Thinly slice white and pale green parts and set aside. Add chopped scallion greens, ginger, garlic, 2 Tbsp. mayonnaise, and 1 tsp. salt to salmon and gently mix to combine. Form mixture into 4 patties about 3/4 inch thick. Transfer to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Chill at least 1 hour or up to 3 hours. Meanwhile, mix sesame oil, 1 tsp. vinegar, remaining 2/3 cup mayonnaise, and a pinch of salt in a small bowl; set aside. Toss cucumbers with a pinch of salt in another small bowl. Massage with your hands for a few minutes to soften and expel liquid; discard liquid. Add chile, sugar, and 2 tsp. vinegar and toss to coat. Cover and chill pickles until ready to assemble burgers. Heat vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Remove salmon patties from refrigerator and sprinkle with flour just to coat the outside (you won’t need all of it). The patties will be a little loose but you can always pat them back together with your hands before they hit the pan. Working in batches and adding more oil in between batches if needed, cook patties until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side (watch carefully; you don’t want to overcook). Toss herbs, watercress, sesame seeds (if using), reserved white and pale green parts of scallions, remaining 1 tsp. vinegar, and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl. Build burgers with buns, patties, herb mixture, pickles, and reserved sauce.']\n"

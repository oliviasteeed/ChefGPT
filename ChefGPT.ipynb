Add the onion, carrots, cashews, and red lentils to a large pot of salted water. Bring to a boil and cook for about 15 minutes, until the carrots are fork-tender. Drain the water and set aside. Cook the pasta in salted water according to the packet instructions. Reserve ¼ cup of pasta water. Transfer cooked onions, carrots, cashews, and lentils to a blender with soy milk, tapioca starch, nutritional yeast, paprika, vegetable stock powder, garlic granules, lemon juice, miso paste, and a pinch of salt. Blend on high speed until perfectly smooth. Transfer the sauce to a large pan (big enough to contain both the sauce and pasta), along with the rosemary sprig, and cook for 5 minutes on medium to low heat, stirring regularly to thicken the sauce. Add the pasta and reserved pasta water. Stir well to coat, and cook for a further 5 minutes. Remove the rosemary, adjust salt and pepper to taste, top with parsley, and enjoy!', 'Using a grater, shred the tofu. Add to a bowl with the avocado, scallion, 2 tsp lime juice, and coconut aminos. Using a fork, mash until thoroughly combined. To a bowl, add the shredded cabbage, remaining 1 tsp lime juice, and a dash of sea salt flakes. Use your hands to massage the cabbage until bright pink. Lay the nori sheet on a clean, dry surface. Then, soak the rice paper roll in lukewarm water for around 3 seconds. Lay the softened rice paper roll on the nori sheet. Using scissors, cut a small slit from one edge of the nori sheet to the middle, which will allow you to fold the wrap once the fillings have been added. Arrange your fillings on the nori sheet. Place the sushi rice on the bottom left side, tofu avocado mix on the top left side, red cabbage on the top right side, and cucumber on the bottom right side. Add the final touches by drizzling sriracha across the rice and sprinkling over the sesame seeds. Fold your wrap, beginning with the bottom side and following the order of the fillings. You can optionally cut the wrap in half sideways or enjoy as is!', 'Prepare the roasted veggies: Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Wash the potatoes thoroughly with the skin on (for a more nutrient-dense option!) and chop them into wedges shape. In a large bowl, mix together the diced potatoes, lemon zest, thyme, oregano, onion flakes, a pinch of salt, plus 1½ teaspoons (8 ml) of the olive oil. Ensure the potatoes are well coated. Spread the potatoes on a baking tray and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. In the same large mixing bowl, combine the harissa, maple syrup, cumin, the remaining half of the olive oil, and a pinch of salt. Add the chickpeas and broccoli florets, mixing well to coat them thoroughly. Add the chickpeas and broccoli to the baking tray with the potatoes and continue to bake for an additional 20 minutes. While the vegetables are roasting, place the almonds in an oven-safe dish and bake for 7 minutes. Once done, remove from the oven and chop roughly. Alternatively you can use pre-roasted almonds. Prepare the tzatziki: Grate the cucumber and use a clean cloth to squeeze out any excess water. In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the soy yogurt, grated cucumber, dill, garlic and lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper to taste. To serve, spread the tzatziki in a bowl. Add the roasted vegetables on top, followed by the tomatoes and almonds. Enjoy!', 'Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, whisk together the coconut sugar and egg until combined. Whisk in the banana, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt. Add the peanut butter and continue to whisk until the dough is smoothly and evenly combined. It will be thick, wet, and sticky. If the dough becomes too hard to whisk, switch to a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Stir in the chocolate chips. Place the dough in the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes. Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. With a cookie scoop or spoon, scoop the dough into 2 tablespoon-sized mounds and place on the prepared baking sheets, leaving 1 1/2 inches of space between each. Sprinkle each cookie with salt, if using. Return any unscooped dough to the refrigerator to chill while the first batch bakes. Bake for 11 to 12 minutes, until the cookies are turning golden at the edges but still look underdone in the center. Place the baking sheet on a cooling rack and let the cookies cool on the sheet for 2 minutes. Gently transfer the cookies to the rack to cool completely (if the cookies are still too delicate to transfer, simply slide the whole piece of parchment with the cookies directly onto the cooling rack). Repeat with the remaining dough, ensuring that you allow the cookie sheets to cool completely between batches.', \"Rinse the red lentils thoroughly under cold water. Optionally, soak the lentils and cashews in cold water overnight. Once soaked, drain the water and rinse again. Although not necessary, this step will make some nutrients more bioavailable. In a large pot, add the lentils, cashews, garlic, chili, ginger, turmeric, cumin, maple syrup, carrots, butternut squash, and vegetable stock. Bring to a soft boil, then reduce the heat, cover partially, and cook for 30 minutes or until the vegetables have softened. Turn off the heat. Blend the soup until perfectly smooth. If using a stand blender, it's recommended to allow it to cool down before blending. Stir in the lemon juice. Adjust salt and pepper to taste, add your favorite toppings, and enjoy!\", 'In a large mixing bowl, stir together mashed banana, vanilla, and peanut butter. Add dry ingredients (cinnamon, brown sugar, oats, salt, and baking soda) to wet ingredients, then stir until just combined. Avoid overmixing. Fold in chocolate chips until evenly distributed. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper. Remove cookie dough from the freezer. Using a 2.5 tablespoon cookie scoop, scoop cold dough into cookie balls, then place them on the baking sheet spaced 2 inches apart. Using your fingertips, gently flatten the rounded tops of the cookie balls. Bake for 9 - 11 minutes or until cookies set around the edges but are still soft in the center. (Cookies will continue to set as they cool, avoid overbaking or cookies will be dry.) If desired, press additional chocolate chips into the tops of warm cookies. Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature up to 3 days.', 'Cook pasta according to package. Drain and set aside in a large pot. While pasta is cooking, add butter and sage leaves to a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-low heat, stirring often. Once butter starts to bubble, stir constantly for about 8-10 minutes until butter browns and turns a deep amber color. Remove sage leaves from butter and place on a separate plate. Set aside for later. As soon as you remove the sage leaves from the pan, immediately add onion to the saucepan and sauté for 4-5 minutes until onion is fragrant and translucent. Add garlic and sauté for 1-2 more minutes. Be careful not to burn garlic! Slowly add almond milk, veggie broth, pumpkin puree, salt, and pepper and whisk to combine. Bring mixture to a simmer. Once pasta is cooked and drained, add to sauce mixture and stir to combine. Stir in sage leaves, parmesan cheese, and spinach until spinach has wilted. Serve immediately topped with pepitas, shredded parmesan, fresh sage leaves, and cracked black pepper.', \"In a large pot or Dutch oven, add oil over medium heat. Once warm, add onion and garlic, and sauté until onions are translucent and fragrant, about 7 minutes. Mix in carrots and celery, and sauté for 5-7 minutes more. Add in the salt, pepper, and flour, and gently toss until veggies are coated. Add milk, vegetable broth, potatoes, bay leaf, thyme, marjoram, and nutmeg. Stir and bring mixture to a boil. Once boiling, turn temperature down to low, cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Remove the bay leaf. Use an immersion blender to blend the soup until somewhat smooth. If you don't have an immersion blender, you can use a potato masher to mash some of the potatoes. I prefer to leave a bit of chunky potato texture to the soup, but if you want it completely smooth, you can fully blend it in a high-powered blender. If you're using a blender, just blend in batches, making sure not to fill your blender past the maximum fill line and be extra careful because the soup will be hot! Spoon soup into bowls for serving and top with toppings of choice. I love serving it with vegan shredded cheese, sour cream, and green onions. Tempeh or coconut bacon bits are also delicious. Let soup cool completely and store in an airtight container for up to 5 days in the fridge.\", 'Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add chicken chunks into the skillet in a single layer. Season with ¼ tsp salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper, cook 3-4 minutes per side until cooked through, for a total of about 8 minutes, or until chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165°F. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil into the same skillet. Add cherry tomatoes, zucchini, broccoli, bell pepper, and onion. Season with remaining ¼ tsp salt and ¼ tsp pepper. Cook for about 5-6 minutes until veggies start to soften and tomatoes start to blister. Be careful not to overcook, otherwise your veggies will become mushy! Add the chicken back to the skillet and stir to combine everything. Turn heat off, then add ½ cup pesto. Stir to coat everything. Serve the pesto chicken and veggies on their own or with cooked pasta or rice. Top with additional pesto, parmesan cheese, and fresh basil, if desired.', 'Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add diced onion and bell pepper, and sauté for about 4-5 minutes until softened. Add spices (chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt, pepper) and frozen corn, and mix to combine. Sauté for 3-4 more minutes or until corn has thawed and is warm. Add cooked chicken and cilantro to the mixture, and stir to combine. Taste and season with additional salt or pepper, if needed. Remove from heat. To assemble the quesadillas, sprinkle a tortilla with ¼ cup of the shredded cheese, leaving a small border all the way around the edge. Spoon ½ cup of the chicken mixture on top of the cheese, then fold the tortilla in half. Repeat with the remaining five tortillas. To cook immediately: Wipe out the skillet (it will still be hot). Increase the heat to medium and lightly coat the skillet with nonstick cooking spray or a little oil. Cook the assembled quesadillas on both sides until golden and the cheese is melted, about 5 to 6 minutes total. Cut the quesadillas into wedges and serve warm with salsa and guacamole.', 'Combine seasoning ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside. Heat 1 Tablespoon of oil over a cast iron pan on medium heat. Once hot add peppers and onion and saute for about 5-7 minutes, until veggies start to soften. Add garlic and half of the seasoning (about 1 ½ Tablespoons) to the veggies and stir to combine. Let veggies saute for 2-3 more minutes. If the pan becomes too dry or the seasoning starts to burn on the pan add a splash of water to the pan. Once veggies reach your desired texture, transfer to a bowl or plate and set aside. Add remaining oil to the cast iron, followed by the chicken strips, remaining seasoning and lime juice. Cook for about 5-6 minutes, until chicken is cooked through. Again, you can add a splash of water if the pan gets too dry. Return veggies to the skillet and stir to combine. Cook for 1-2 more minutes just to heat everything up. Serve chicken and veggies in warm tortillas with toppings of choice. I recommend sour cream (or Greek yogurt), guacamole, shredded lettuce and pico de gallo.', 'Add oil to a dutch oven or large pot and heat over medium heat. Once hot, add onion and red pepper and sauté for 5-7 minutes until softened and fragrant. Add garlic and sauté for 1-2 additional minutes. Add sausage, Italian seasoning, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using). Cook for 7-10 minutes until browned and cooked throughout. Add tomato paste and stir to combine for 1-2 minutes. Add 2 cups of sauce (16 oz), tomatoes, and broth. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, add noodles, then reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 15-20 minutes until noodles are tender. While the soup is simmering, add the remaining 1 cup of sauce and cottage cheese to a blender and blend until smooth and creamy. Once noodles are tender, add spinach, vinegar, and blended cottage cheese mixture. Let simmer for an additional 5 minutes until the spinach has wilted. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed or add additional broth if desired. Serve hot topped with fresh parmesan, mozzarella, and basil. Enjoy!', 'Preheat the oven to 400°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper, set aside. Add tomatoes and garlic to a large bowl and toss them with 3 Tablespoons of olive oil. Spread tomatoes and garlic onto the prepared baking sheet in a single layer and sprinkle with ½ tsp salt and ½ tsp pepper. Roast for 40 minutes. While tomatoes are roasting, in a Dutch oven or large pot, heat remaining 1 Tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions, ½ tsp of salt and ¼ tsp pepper. Sauté, stirring occasionally until onions are translucent and start to brown and caramelize, about 20 minutes. Once onions are caramelized add Italian seasoning and vegetable broth. Let simmer for 5-10 minutes. At this point your tomatoes should be done roasting. Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly before transferring the tomatoes, along with the garlic and juices into the Dutch oven. Turn down heat and add fresh basil. Use an immersion blender to blend the soup until smooth. If you don’t have an immersion blender you can use a blender. Carefully transfer the soup mixture into your blender and blend until smooth or until you reach your desired consistency. You may need to do this in batches, depending on the size of your blender. Taste and add any additional salt and pepper and more vegetable broth, if desired, to reach your preferred consistency. When ready to serve, divide soup into 4 bowls. Garnish with fresh basil and serve with parmesan cheese, as well as, crusty bread, grilled cheese or crackers.', 'In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery, stirring occasionally until veggies have softened and are fragrant, about 7 minutes. Stir in garlic, thyme, cinnamon (if using), bay leaf, salt, and pepper, and cook for 1-2 additional minutes. Add 1 Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to deglaze the pot.

Saute for a few more minutes to let the spices cook. Add in chicken broth, chicken thighs, corn, salt, pepper, and lime juice. Bring soup to a boil, then cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20-30 minutes until chicken is fully cooked and no longer pink. Once chicken is cooked, remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a cutting board to shred with two forks. Add shredded chicken back to the pot, taste, and adjust seasonings if necessary. Serve and enjoy!', 'Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9 inch springform pan with nonstick cooking spray or melted butter. Place cookies into the bowl of a food processor and pulse for 1-2 minutes or until cookies are finely crushed. Add in melted butter and process again until well combined. Dump the mixture into the prepared pie pan and press into the bottom and side evenly. It should come up at least an inch to an inch and a half on the sides. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool. The crust needs to be somewhat cool before adding the filling. To make the filling: In a large saucepan, mix the yolks, sugar, cornstarch and salt until well combined and thick. In a separate pot, bring milk to a slight simmer (do not boil). Once simmering, remove from heat and whisk in ⅓ cup of the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking quickly to avoid curdling. Slowly whisk in the rest of the hot milk, then place the pan over medium heat. Continue whisking until the mixture thickens to a custard-like consistency. Once the mixture thickens, remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract, bourbon, and butter until well combined. Add banana slices all over the bottom of the pie crust, then pour the filling into the cooled crust and smooth the top. Cover with plastic wrap so it touches the filling and refrigerate for 2-4 hours or until cold. To make the whipped cream topping: Beat heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract on high until stiff peaks form. Spread whipped cream evenly over the pie filling, then garnish with dark chocolate shavings or dust with cocoa powder. Serve 9-12 slices, depending on size. Store the pie in the fridge for a few days if properly covered.', 'Heat olive oil in a large pot and add onion with a pinch of salt. Saute onion until it is translucent and tender (not browned), this takes about 5 minutes. Add in the garlic, asparagus and beans and season with a bit of salt and pepper and give it all a stir. Pour in the veggie broth and crank the heat to high bringing everything to a boil. Reduce down to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes or until the asparagus is fork tender. Shut off the heat and let the soup cool for a few minutes before blending. Working in batches, spoon the soup into your blender, filling the blender no more than 1/4-1/3rd of the way up. Place on the lid, leaving it slightly ajar so steam can escape and blend until the soup is rich and creamy. Repeat until you have finished all the soup. Serve right away! Or, transfer back to the pot to reheat and serve OR store in an airtight container in your fridge for up to 5 days.', 'Heat sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat.

Cook for another three minutes or until the veggies are tender but still vibrant. Add in rice, low sodium soy sauce, and sesame seeds. Stir together and cook for five more minutes or until all the flavors have combined and the rice is heated through. In the meantime, heat a small nonstick pan over low heat, add a little coconut oil to the bottom of the pan (you can also use butter or ghee) and then add one Happy Egg to the pan at a time. Once you see the whites start to set up, add a splash of water to the pan and pop on a lid for about 30 seconds. This allows the whites to cook through but leaves the yolks super vibrant and runny. Slide the finished egg right over your fried rice to finish the dish. Repeat for each serving, serve and enjoy!', 'Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake liners (you can use paper or silicone liners) + 4 cups of a second pan (or work in batches since the recipe makes 16 mini pies in total). In a food processor combine; pecans and coconut and pulse back and forth until they have broken down. You want to have a consistency similar to sand that sticks together when pinched between your fingers. Be careful not to over mix or you will end up with nut butter. Add in the maple syrup, coconut oil and sea salt. Pulse again until everything is well combined. Divide the nut mixture as evenly as possible between all sixteen cups and then use your fingers to pat it down in each cup to form a crust for each mini pie. Set aside.
